       "  'text': \"Great place!  It was a clean and nice place to stay the night. Yolande was very helpful, kind and communicative. I had a late check-in, but she was more than willing to make up for the waiting. Great I had a great stay, Yolande was very helpful and the place was really clean. This was a great stay! Thanks again Yolande. It is a very close place to subway station. Good for you who  plans to go home quiet late at night. It is located in the main road, police are patrolling around.  Had a wonderful stay in the Bronx! Yolande was accommodating even when my flight was delayed and I could check in close to midnight! Thank you for an amazing stay! Really nice time, perfect host. I felt very welcomed, as if I was staying with a family member. Yolande has an inviting spirit. Had a wonderful stay- Yolande is friendly and welcoming. Her child is adorable too! She keeps the entire apartment very clean and tidy. The apartment is within walking distance to both Mt Eden and 170st subway.  The place was exactly as (URL HIDDEN) was clean and tidy.She was super nice and her son is adorable.Highly recommended. The host family is very warm and her place is nice. I strongly recommend it! Yolande was an amazing host! Made me feel truly welcome. And she was flexible with times for checking in and out Yolande is the quintessential hostess. She is super accommodating and keeps an immaculate looking place. I most definitely enjoyed my stay and definitely am going to stay again.  I had a great time staying with Yolande and her son.  They were extremely accommodating and the apartment was very clean. Ms. Yolande, was truly amazing! Her son was amazing, house was clean, and it was just an amazing stay!   I've stayed multiple times now with Yolande, and it's always a pleasure. She is a wonderful hostess.   Yolande was so nice and accommodating every step of the way. She's a wonderful host and great conversation! The room was spacious and clean. Would definitely stay here again. \"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Great Host. Flexible and accommodating, awesome stay! Jose was great! Very accommodating with arrival as I had strange travel plans which changed a few times. I met him to receive the keys and he was very responsive by text. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe description is correct, it is an artistic apartment. Quiet neighbourhood, close to the subway system. Kitchen was well equipped. Lots of space and big bed. Felt safe in the apartment.\\r\\nWould definitely stay again and recommend. The stay and the apartment were great.  It was clean and provided us exactly what we needed.  The neighborhood was fine and the apartment is across the street from a school.  Seemed like a typical Bronx neighborhood, but felt safe all the while.  The subway is barely 2 blocks away if that and we had great access to Yankee Stadium (our purpose) but also easy access down to Times Square.  No complaints at all.  Jose had everything lined up for us and key transfer was very simple.  Jose he is a very nice host. I love the neighborhood everything you need i mean EVERYTHING you need was a 2 min walk away. Parking wasn\\'t an issue for me maybe because i was lucky i always found a spot right in front of the house. The house is very clean and unique . I would rent this apartment again.    Listing description very accurate. Jose was very welcoming. Apartment is located very close to metro line, I definitely had a great time! Jose was the best host I have ever had. He was easy to communicate with, always friendly & helpful, & his place is super cozy & comfortable. I loved looking at all of his art - it\\'s just a really nice space to be. I enjoyed the neighborhood too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat & highly recommend this listing - not only because it\\'s a great apartment but also because Jose is an incredibly nice guy & perfect host. Thanks for making my stay with Fifty so comfortable !! UHHHH-MAZING!!!! Jose was great and his place is awesome. Great location, walking distance to great and essential stores, banks, and public transportation. Place was spacious quiet and has a friendly neighborhood. I now have a new favorite place to stay in NY! Highly recommended!!! Thanks Jose!!! The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. My stay at Jose was just as good asthe second time as it was the first time. Jose was all available when I needed him. His place is really clean. It was helpful that the 4 pm is close to his trains. Anything you might want or need is right outside your from door. I would visit Jose apartment in heart and I would recommended it to all my friend. Jose was very easy to reach and so helpful, even when we rushed out and I forgot my metrocard in the room but had to get to the Yankees game he helped us get on the train.  Apartment was comfortable and nice strong shower.  Love all the shoes :) Jose\\'s place was very comfortable and convenient.The apartment is spacious, has a nice big bedroom with queensize bed.Jose was available all the time and helped me a lot during my stay. Jose was a great host. His home is funky and cool, but also well taken care of. He allowed me to check in and check out at the time that was most convenient for me. He gave me all the info I needed to have a comfortable stay. neighbor hood is what it is, but felt safe all the time. parking is tough ,you need to watch out for hours and times of cleaning.\\r\\nThe apartment was a little oasis in the neighborhood and its very artsy. bed and bedding comfortable.\\r\\nthanks a mill. Jose was very accommodating and did everything he could to ensure that I had everything I needed. The apartment is in a convenient location close to public transportation. I will definitely consider this place again in the future.  Jose\\'s apartment is nice clean and conveniently located. Transportation was easy and we encountered no problems whatsoever. The art was awesome and definitely interesting. I will definitely stay there again.  Great would do it again!!! Secure building, very clean flat, comfortable bed with fresh sheets, fresh towels, great shower! less than a 5 minute walk to 2 subway stops, food places just outside the front door. The only slight negative is the noise from the neighbours at the weekend. The apartment is as described. Well it is actually a bit roomier than what i expected it to be, which was a nice surprise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are subway stations close by and especially the D train is a quick way to get to midtown Manhattan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the area, some people may have reservations about the Bronx. Well, the locals I spoke with were friendly and polite and I\\'d stay here again. Coming from a county of rather plain manners, getting called \"sir\" here made me feel embarrassed, but of course pleased at the same time.  This is my second time staying in Jose\\'s apartment and enjoyed my stay as much as last time. \\nI like to stay in a local neighbourhood when I\\'m in NYC. The neighbourhood is safe and the apartment is nicely located by the subway station (2mins walk) and you\\'re in the city in no time. \\nThe apartment is as described and Jose is a good host and a true New Yorker with good knowledge of the city. \\nIf you want to experience the real New York then stay here in a real New York neighbourhood. \\nI\\'ll probably be back again next year again  Joses place is cool the neighborhood is very lively and in the middle of everything you need! Would stay gere again any time Jose was very accommodating and his place was close to 4 train and D train so it made it easy for me to get around. Parking is extremely hard especially in the night. Other than that I had a great stay because it was close to my family and the local foods were great.  We were very pleased with our stay at Jose\\'s.  Everything was exactly as described and depicted in the listing.  The apartment was extremely clean and Jose provided fresh towels and bed sheets.  Upon arrival he reviewed the apartment and house rules and also left written notes.  All of the artwork hanging around the place was really cool.  \\r\\n \\r\\nJose was a great host. Great communication before, during and after our stay.  Very accessible by phone, text and email.  He was very gracious and accommodating when our arrival time was delayed by traffic.  He also responded very quickly after our stay when we thought we left something (which we ended up finding in our bag).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood itself is an authentic NYC neighborhood.  We thought it was great and enjoyed ourselves a lot more than we would have staying in some hotel or somewhere outside of the city.  We did not feel unsafe at any time during our stay.  My girlfriend and I walked around the neighborhood and to/from the metro many times during our stay.  Both nights of our stay we rode the metro back and then walked from the station at close to 2 am and felt perfectly safe.  My vehicle was parked a block away for our 2 day stay and there were no issues.   \\r\\n\\r\\nParking is tight.....its NYC.  Street parking is available and you just have to be patient until a spot opens up.  We double parked in front of the apartment to meet with Jose and then unload (its perfectly fine to do) and we drove around the neighborhood until we spotted someone pulling out about a block away.  It takes time and patience but once you park you are good. We kept the same spot for 2 days.  Pay attention to the various parking signs and fire hydrants to ensure you are not parked illegally.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for our trip was to attend an event at Yankee Stadium.  The location was incredibly convenient to the stadium.  A short one block walk to the metro and two quick stops later you are standing in front of the Stadium.  It really was that easy.  The perfect place to stay if attending a Yankee game.  From the Yankee Stadium stop you can then take the D train to quickly get to many popular visitor spots around NYC.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend Jose\\'s place to anyone looking for a place to stay in NYC.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThank You Again For Everything Jose! Jose was an incredible host and very kind in accommodating me throughout my trip. The apartment was clean and amazingly creative, I loved his sense of style and his personality. The location was perfect surrounded by a ton of food and retail, everything I needed was within short distance! \\n\\nAnytime I travel to New York city I know exactly where to turn to! Thank you Jose for an amazing stay in the Bronx!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I stayed with Douglas for a single night while visiting Montefiore Medical Center and would definitely stay with him again.  He was very welcoming and had even picked up a few extra things for the kitchen especially for my arrival.  The room is big with lots of shelving and closet space.  The apartment is located close to a subway stop on the B/D line and one on the 4 line.  My only cautions for potential renters are 1) the heating system in the room is loud, so if you are a light sleeper this may disturb you 2) I found I had to choose between a hot shower or one with good pressure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t able to achieve both, but that could have just been me, 3) at the time of my visit Douglas had not setup any internet yet and so you either need to rely on a data plan from your phone or do without.  Douglas also has to work throughout most of the day, so if you want to arrive or leave earlier in the day, you need to coordinate with him beforehand.  I think any shortcomings with the apartment are well balanced by the price and you get a very good value. i really enjoyed my stay at douglas\\' and will probably do it again,its a nice and quite place,Douglas is mostly not around,it feels like u have the place to your whole self all day.hes still not set up a wifi yet. Douglas is a good guy and really enjoyed his hospitality Doug was an amazing host. Close to subway. Big room. Douglas is a great host.  The apartment is two blocks from the B/D so it was very convenient to getting around NY.  The room is large and quiet with a TV and wireless internet.  Douglas is very nice-- he even helped me with my apartment search.  I\\'d definitely stay here again. Doug was a great host, five stars, highly recommended! Douglas is the type of rare good soul that is so very hard to find! I only wish the stay was longer! Conveniently located to the B and D as well as the 4 trains which run express to Manhattan, you could not help but love the wonderful prices for fruits and other foods compared to the same products you would find anywhere else. A+ indeed!  It is a good place to stay if you have a limited budget. Very close to the subway, quite and roomy enough - it took me only about 20 - 30 minutes to get to Manhattan. I will probably try to rent the same room next time when I am in New York. I stayed at Douglas\\'s place for a week backpacking NYC for the first time, and I was honestly thrilled at the location and space I got.  I was only a few minutes from the subway and once you got on, manhattan was only 10-15 minutes away and the B/D got me mostly to where I needed to go.  The bed was clean along with the bathroom, it is in an older apartment building though so dont expect anything special, but for the price you pay, this place is a steal especially since you dont have to share the room.  Douglas was nice and I would definitely crash here again. Douglas is the best host I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever met. The apartment pictures are very accurate. The room is very spacious and comfortable. It is conveniently located from train D and 4. Staying at Dougla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is like having your own apartment as Douglas works all day long. And he keeps his place very organized and clean which made me feel good. As soon as, I booked Douglas had the time to explain to me how to get to his place, he was very welcoming and helpful. By the time I knocked on the door I received the keys apartment, so I could come and go as I pleased. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely stay here when I go back in New York.  I love Douglas !!! We spent less than 24 hours at Doug\\'s place. We had a layover before going to our next destination. Doug was very accommodating considering our flight was late getting into JFK. The place was clean. We hope to stay there again!  Douglas is a wonderful and accommodating host. He is generous with information on local amenities and everything that is required for a guest\\'s stay in his Bronx neighbourhood. Much Spanish is spoken in this part of the Bronx, so one can practice his Spanish, which was great for me. My room was large, clean and comfortable, with free access to kitchen. Location appeared to be safe enough and was an easy commute to midtown, although a 30-40-minute subway ride (subway station: 170th St). Close to all major highways, if driving into the Bronx area. Agreed about the shower, but if a little cold water is added, the pressure is fine. The shower curtain needs to be replaced. Wonderful-- I like Douglas! last month stayed in douglas place for 5 days,great bargain for the price i payed,room good size easy transport links and douglas very friendly host our stay here was a great pleasure,Douglas is very welcoming host.. The neighborhood is latinos but safe, we had no problems there. There is not enough of place for free parking on the street close to building but you can find it maybe two blocs further. For the price you pay you can not ask for more, big room, near subway into manhattan quickly  Douglas is absolutely a great host. He was very kind, helpful and generous. I really enjoyed my stay in his apartment. The room is pretty large with a comfortable bed and fast internet. The area is quiet and safe and the subway station is very close. \\r\\nI strongly recommend this room and host! I highly recommend staying at Douglas\\'s place. The accommodations are just as described, Douglas is a very nice man and the area is very safe and very close to Manhattan.\\r\\nThis is my best experience in NY using Airbnb. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time staying with Douglas! He\\'s super nice, polite, and easy to talk to. Even though the building itself is quite old, Douglas made sure that the room was very clean and comfy. The bed sheet was very comfortable, and he also gave us clean towels to use. Douglas also bought us bananas for breakfast. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is not the most convenient if you want to go to Manhattan, but the metro is only a few minutes away! It\\'s a really great deal for the price you pay.  My one week stay at Douglas\\'s place was outstanding.  Douglas is a very friendly host and keeps an exceedingly clean and orderly home.  The room itself is spacious, clean, and includes a comfortable bed with plenty of storage space for your luggage.  I was pleasantly surprised at how calm, quiet, and peaceful the nights were up in this area of the Bronx: no honking horns or other \"city\" noises that can be a bother when staying in the middle of a city.  The apartment is located a short walk from the subway (approximately 2-5 minutes depending on the subway line you use).  On any future trips to NYC, I will definitely check to see if Douglas\\'s apartment is available again.  Highly recommended. Thank you Douglas! I had a nice stay in Douglas\\'flat. He is very friendly :-) \\nI enjoyed my stay, and it\\'s very near from the subway, very quieck to go to Mannathan.  Doug was a very nice host, He  showed me around the apartment, explained the neighborhood, handed me a set of keys, towel and soap and gave me the space I needed to relax during my short stay. Very nice person. The room was clean, the bed comfy, the water in the shower very hot and apartment very well heated.  Three blocks to the subway. Can\\'t ask for more convenience. I look forward to stay with Doug again when the need arises.   It was our first my wife\\'s and my first time in New York.\\nIt was a wonderful stay.\\nEvery day we found out new things and saw new places. Douglas is a great host! Very nice friendly and concerned about my needs . If you have any problems, please talk to him he will settle and leave you as comfortable as possible .\\r\\nThe room is great place for you to store your things . It has Wi-Fi internet and TV in the room . Furthermore the room has heating and in my case it was not necessary to sleep with blanket. He let me use the kitchen and its appliances ( microwave, fridge , cutlery , cups, plates , etc. ) . The bathroom is very clean and ideal for cold days NYC hot water. He gave me the keys to be able to enter the apartment and thus could freely visit NYC .\\r\\nWe had great conversations about life in the U.S. . The neighborhood is very safe and quiet great to sleep at night after a long day visiting Manhattan . The apartment is right next to the train station metro D.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tip for when you are staying with Douglas . It comes out very early to work and this also sleep early so do not make noise when back street at night ok ? Douglas is very cool and have all the respect for their guests .\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly am staying with Douglas next visit to NYC .\\r\\n\\r\\nDouglas \\xc3\\xa9 um \\xc3\\xb3timo anfitri\\xc3\\xa3o! Muito simp\\xc3\\xa1tico agrad\\xc3\\xa1vel e preocupado com minhas necessidades. Se voc\\xc3\\xaa tiver algum problema ou d\\xc3\\xbavida fale com ele que ele ir\\xc3\\xa1 resolver e deixar voc\\xc3\\xaa o mais confort\\xc3\\xa1vel poss\\xc3\\xadvel. \\r\\nO quarto \\xc3\\xa9 grande com lugar para voc\\xc3\\xaa guardar suas coisas. Ele tem internet Wi-fi  e TV no quarto. Al\\xc3\\xa9m disto o quarto possui aquecimento e no meu caso n\\xc3\\xa3o foi necess\\xc3\\xa1rio dormir com cobertor. Ele me deixou usar a cozinha e seus utens\\xc3\\xadlios (microondas, geladeira,  talheres, copos, pratos e etc). O banheiro \\xc3\\xa9 limpo e com muita \\xc3\\xa1gua quente ideal para os dias frios de NYC.  Ele me deu as chaves para poder entrar no apartamento e com isto pude visitar livremente NYC.\\r\\nTivemos \\xc3\\xb3timas conversas acerca da vida nos EUA. O Bairro \\xc3\\xa9 muito seguro e silencioso \\xc3\\xb3timo para dormir a noite depois de um longo dia de visita a Manhattan. O apartamento esta bem pr\\xc3\\xb3ximo a esta\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o de metro do trem D. \\r\\n\\r\\nUma dica para voc\\xc3\\xaa quando estiver hospedado com Douglas. Ele sai muito cedo para trabalhar e por isto tamb\\xc3\\xa9m dorme cedo ent\\xc3\\xa3o n\\xc3\\xa3o fa\\xc3\\xa7a barulho quando voltar da rua a noite ok? Douglas \\xc3\\xa9 muito legal e deve ter todo o respeito dos seus h\\xc3\\xb3spedes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertamente me hospedarei com Douglas na pr\\xc3\\xb3xima visita a NYC. A nice, large and clean room with a good bed in The Bronx/Manhattan. Use of kitchen and bathroom, WiFi and TV. Douglas is a very kind man, even brought me to the airport because my plane was leaving very early. I found it noisy but I live in a well insulated building. Bought ear plugs and then slept perfect. I had a pleasant stay! Douglas, was an awesome host. Very friendly and  hospitable. The apartment was super clean and the train was extremely close. I would highly recommend his place for your next stay in the city.  I had a very good experience staying at Douglas\\' place. The room is very spacious and clean. Radiators provided plenty of heat. The neighborhood is a different experience but it is a very friendly neighborhood and I always felt safe. His place is a short walk to the subway station with B and D line, taking about 30 mins to get downtown. It took about 1.5 hours to get to JFK (B/D - E - airtrain) but the train transfers were relatively painless with minimal walking and stairs. The convenience was good especially since I was traveling with large bags. Also, there were elevators up to the apartment so again, no hoisting luggage up and down flights of steps. I would definitely stay here again. I found \"my home\" in New York, a large room clean, with a large TV wifi internet,with a small breakfast included and  just 1 block from metro station stop,and in 20 minutes  you get to the 59th, and the \"plus\" of this choice is Douglas. a good person. So when I return in New York I know where go.Super recommended. This is the perfect place to stay, if you need to be in the city for a few days.  Douglas is a great host, and was very accommodating.  The room is large and there is wifi and tv.  Especially for the price this is a great place! I had a great stay here! It was cozy and roomy for a new york apartment. It is close to a couple of convenience stores and a short walk to the metro. I stayed here for an interview nearby and a short vacation while I was here. I am a poor college student so I didn\\'t want to spend money on a hotel room if I was only going to sleep in it. I spent most of the day out in NYC so this place really was perfect and very inexpensive. There is a heater and you can have full access to the kitchen and bathroom. Douglas also leaves food our for you for the morning as he starts his days early. I didn\\'t run into him much as I am on a college wake/sleep cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos do not do the room justice at all. There are two closets and a lot of shelf and hanging space all around the room. He also provides hangers for you to use. I didn\\'t know this and brought my own to hang my interview clothes, but he does offer a lot of things that a hotel does. There is an iron and ironing board, a hairdryer, ample outlets, shelves, hangers, free wi-fi, a TV, and a full-sized mirror. I am sure I am leaving things out but it was really much better than I expected, especially for the price. I had a great time at Douglas place! I felt very welcome eventhough I didnt see him very much. \\r\\nThe room is very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I liked the neighborhood because it is different from Manhattan or Brooklyn and I always felt very safe.\\r\\nI would come back any time.  It was so great! Not only Douglas is so nice and kind But it is also reasonable price. I will definitely recommend this place for my friends. Nice place and very good price. Plus Douglas was so helpful he got us a subway map and helped us finding an ice rink in the city. It is really the place to be if you are travelling low budget. Douglas is a great person - really helpful and a great host.\\r\\nThe place is only few minutes from the D and B subway line, which makes it really convenient. There is a supermarket (and Rite-Aid) right across the street, so if you are for a long stay you can buy groceries and cook at the place. \\r\\nThe neighborhood is very nice, quite and safe. It is a Hispanic neighborhood so you\\'ll get a chance to practice your Spanish. \\r\\nGreat place for a very affordable price.  I stayed a few days, everything was good, quiet, clean, not far from subway. Douglas is very friendly. Best wishes for him. Douglas is so nice and friendly!  Unlike some airbnb places that feel like living in a busy college dorm, staying with Douglas feels like living with one very quiet and respectful roommate.  Large room; fast wifi; full kitchen; good bathroom, although the hot water can be totally erratic (keeping the shower at very low pressure helps).  As others have mentioned, the radiator and pipes do make frequent whooshing noises, but nothing too bad.  Overall: this is a very good bargain, with a great host. Very nice bedroom, Douglas is a very good friendly guy. \\r\\nHe gave me advices on subway lines. \\r\\nI highly recommend this apartment. \\r\\nThanks a lot Douglas.  Nice, clean room with tv, wi-fi and big, comfy bed. Good location, close to Subway D and 4, witch are connected with Manhattan. Close to supermarkets. And Douglas. He is perfect host. Because my cancel flight I was in his apartment on 2.30 at night. With any problems at check in. Airlines also lost my luggage with my winter clothes. And he gave me his hot sweater and jacket. Very helpfull and nice man. Highly, highly recommended! Douglas is the best ever.\\r\\nRespectful and calm. You get everything you need during your stay and even more.\\r\\nHe is careful and friendly and the flat has perfect location to public transportation.\\r\\nLaundry and Grocery can be found in few steps around. Neighbours are also great and quiet.\\r\\nSo you will certainly get what you paid for. What can I say about Douglas that already hasn\\'t been said?!? The guy is awesome and very accommodating to your needs. The room is spacious. VERY SPACIOUS! Super quiet neighborhood and friendly neighbors. If Douglas is still on airbnb when I\\'m in NYC city again, I\\'ll definitely be staying here, with no hesitation. Thanks Mr. DeLeon :) The location is great, very clean and quiet. The bed is very comfortable. Bathroom very clean, good shower with exellent water temperature. Safe location very close to the lines 4 and D subway. Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants nearby. Douglas is the best! Recommend, helped me in many things, had patience with my bad English. This is the best place in the Bronx! I was more than comfortable staying in Douglas\\' apartment, as I imagine anyone would be.  The place is quiet and easily accessible from the subways (both the 4 & D trains will take you right there, about a 35-45 min ride from lower Manhattan), the bed is cozy, and all amenities you could need are provided (TV, fast internet, clean sheets & towels, soap, coffee, filtered water).  The entire apartment is quite clean and you can tell Douglas makes a concerted effort to keep it that way.  Additionally, Douglas is a truly generous, gracious & respectful host, and an all-around good person.  He gave me excellent tips & advice for my time spent in the bright lights of the big city.  I am truly grateful to him for opening his home to me, and there\\'s no way you\\'re going to find a more reasonable price this close to Manhattan. Douglas is really nice and helpful, he offered tips on what to do in NY and the room is great!  Excellent host.  Very accomodating and caring.  The place itself is an older building but the room is really big and nice. It was a fantastic travel and Douglas has done much to this : very welcoming, helpful and nice, and in addition to that the room was great. The district is safe and quiet, and the subway is only 3 minutes by foot! If you want to save money, go to Douglas\\'s place, you won\\'t be disappointed! Very good experience. No problem with communication, public traffic, close vicinity.  Great visit in new York !,,,, Douglas was great host!,, Simple and good. I really recommend it! Douglas was great, very welcoming and kind. The flat was clean and even had a TV and food for me. I contacted him last minute and he replied within minutes and he got a friend to take me to the flat.\\r\\nThanks Douglas If you look for a confortable and unexpensive place to stay in NYC, this is a very good solution. The apt. is clean, room is large, and Douglas is a very corteous host! Douglas is a great and very welcoming host! He picked me up at the subway station and invited me to a very healthy juice made by himself. The room was clean and definitely met my needs. If you are looking for a not that expensive place to stay in NYC, I would recommend you to stay with Douglas. \\xe6\\x88\\xbf\\xe4\\xb8\\x9c\\xe5\\xbe\\x88\\xe5\\x8f\\x8b\\xe5\\x96\\x84\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\xe6\\x88\\xbf\\xe9\\x97\\xb4\\xe7\\xa9\\xba\\xe9\\x97\\xb4\\xe4\\xb9\\x9f\\xe5\\xa4\\xa7,\\xe9\\x80\\x82\\xe5\\x90\\x88\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe5\\x9c\\xa8\\xe5\\x9c\\xb0\\xe6\\x9d\\xbf\\xe4\\xb8\\x8a\\xe5\\xa0\\x86\\xe4\\xb8\\x9c\\xe8\\xa5\\xbf\\xe3\\x80\\x82 Douglas was great!!  He is very welcoming and even greeted us with umbrellas since it was raining when we arrived.  He offered to let us use his kitchen and fridge and even had items ready for us to use.  His wifi & cable work perfectly.  His place is only about 3 blocks from the 4 train to Manhattan (about 15-25 min depending on your stop).  It\\'s also close to the D train.  His place is very clean and the building is very quiet.  If you\\'ve never been to NYC, don\\'t be surprised by the trash in the neighborhood (It\\'s not like Douglas can clean up the Bronx by himself).  I would advise staying on Grand Concourse on your walks home; there are just more people around and it was more comfortable than taking the back roads (**girl\\'s perspective).  We came in around 1230-1AM often and never had any issues.  Do try to stay quiet since Douglas works early; he is very quiet in the mornings so it\\'s only fair to do the same for him.  We actually only saw him when we picked up the keys and were able to communicate through AirBnB after that.  :) Thanks Douglas for a really great stay! The room is just as described - big, comfortable and clean. Douglas was very welcoming and helpful - a wonderful introduction to the Bronx. Subway is close with easy access into Manhattan. All around I definitely recommend! The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We had 10 great days in Douglas\\' apartment. His place is quiet, clean and easily accessible from the subways (both the 4 & D trains). The room is very big and is just like in the pictures. We had TV, fast internet, acces to all the kitchen facilities, clean sheets & towels, soap, coffee, filtered water - well everything. We did not see Douglad much during our stay, but he seems very nice and generous - as an example he brought us a lot of fruit for our breakfast. If we ever go back to NY we will definetely stay with Douglas again!  It is very easy to go to  the subway.The house is small but ok for staying for several days. Douglas was an AMAZING host! He provided very good directions on finding the location. \\r\\nThe room was very comfortable and clean. There is plenty of shelf and closest space provided. There is also an air conditioner and t.v. In the room. \\r\\nDouglas also provided coffee, fruit and bread which was a very nice touch. \\r\\nThe location is great because it\\'s two blocks from the train and a 15 minute train ride to Manhattan. \\r\\nOverall a great experience and I will definitely be staying here again when I return to NYC.  I really enjoyed staying at Douglas Apartment. The room was large with a huge and comfy kingsize bed. There was also a TV and Wi-Fi and a well working A/C if it was too hot.\\nDouglas is a great host. I met him twice, but he was friendly and explained everything. I would stay at this room again, if I ever visit NY. Douglas was really nice and looked after us well. The room was huge very clean and had good air con. Just be wary that the Bronx can be a little dodgy at night so dont plan on coming home too late. Just be alert and the apartment is a 1 min walk down the main road from the subway so its all fine. For the money you save staying out of manhatten this room is well worth it. Douglas is very helpful and i had a nice week in his flat. Its very near to the Subway only 2 minutes.\\n\\n Had a very enjoyable 2 week stay in New York at Douglas\\'s apartment in the Bronx. The location was convenient being a few minutes walk from several subway lines and also various grocery and other stores, takeaways and launderettes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDouglas himself is a busy person but was very friendly and also very helpful when the occasion demanded. In particular Douglas helped me to locate and then get my suitcase delivered from JFK Airport, after it had somehow missed my flight from Europe arriving on the following day\\'s flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould i be in New York again i would definitely like to stay at Douglas\\'s apartment.  It\\'s really near subway,maybe only 1 min walk. But if you want to go downtown,it may take some time.Enough space for luggage,large and comfy bed. He is nice and offer enough privacy for guests. His place is a good choice for backpackers.Should be careful if you\\'re a girl.  Douglas was a very hospitable host. Very near D train and 4 tran stations. Huge room too.  Great place to stay. Clean and very close to 2 different subway lines.  Onlt ran into Douglas once but he was very friendly.  Great price for NYC.  Would stay again in a return trip to New York. Douglas was a great host always around to help. The. place was simply great it was as described a quite well lit large room that was only around 20-30 minutes to Manhattan using the express lines (subway just a 5 min walk away).\\r\\n\\r\\n Douglas was a very welcoming host and did little extra things to make me feel welcome. It was nice after a long trip to have towel and soap laid out. The place is about 3 blocks from the nearest subway which with heavy bags is a bit annoying. Once I got use to the location, it was a good base to explore New York. The room was exactly how he described. It is huge and very clean. The room was ready for me with clean bed and towel when I got there. The neighborhood is quite, but if you\\'re traveling alone and female I wouldn\\'t say it is too safe to walk alone at night, but everywhere in NYC is like that especially Bronx. \\r\\nDouglas was very kind and helpful when you need him. You can reach him easily through email or texts. The subway station is close by about couple blocks away.  It was a very comfortable place to stay. Very large room, as was shown in the picture, and very quite. You can reach to the down town very easily with the subway line D. The subway station is quite near. \\r\\n\\r\\nDouglas was a very nice and kind host. No issues about inconvenience or un-comfortableness while I was staying there. I highly recommend to others!    I would really like to appreciate the hospitality and kindness of Douglas. I really enjoyed my stay in his apartment. He is very kind  person and provided all the essential things for the breakfast. Also the stop is very near to his accomodation (almost 2-3 minutes walk).\\r\\nI strongly recommend every one to stay in his place while you go to Newyork.\\r\\n  \\r\\n Douglas war ein sehr zuverl\\xc3\\xa4ssiger und diskreter Gastgeber. Ich empfehle die Unterkunft weiter. Douglas was an excellent host and provided easy to access immaculate accommodation. He was absolutely friendly and respected privacy and the occassional chat. Would love to stay here again I had a wonderful 3 night stay at Douglas\\' place! He is a really nice, welcoming and open person and he\\'ll make sure you have a good time during your stay. I\\'ve been in the city the whole time and he\\'s at work most of the time but when we met we had a good time and once sat together and shared some ice cream. He always bought something small for breakfast for me and was extremely flexible concerning the dates of my trip!\\nMost important for most of you probably is to know whether the area is safe. I can only speak for myself but I never was in a strange situation or felt afraid while I was there. Plus, the subway station is really close to the apartment! However, I am a tall guy and I can imagine that for some younger girl this might be different. But if you\\'re self confident enough this is an appropriate place to stay. \\nThe apartment is not new and there\\'s some things that don\\'t look nice but I\\'m sure this is not what all of us were looking for.\\nThe kitchen offers anything you might need to cook which is a great advantage as well. \\n\\nI hope you will enjoy your stay as much as I did! Douglas did everything to make our stay comfortable, we could use all his kitchen equipment and he even provided us food for breakfast and to make sandwiches. He is a very discreet man and respected our privacy, so it really felt like having an apartmet for ourselves. The neighbourhood is well connected to the subway system, it is about 20-30 minutes to Manhattan and cheap supermarkets are in a close reach. \\r\\nThank you for our great time in New York! good place to stay, host is a really nice person! Easy to get by subway My stay with Douglas was very cool. Even when he was not at home due to his job, he did everything he could to help me in my trip to New York. He gave me advice on what to do and how to use public transportation. I never had a problem in the neighborhood, and they are plenty of food stores one or two blocks away. Definitely recommend staying with Douglas. It\\'s a good place for explore NY.  Also Douglas was so nice and friendly. The room is like the photo. Dauglas is a really nice host. He is very helpful and kind during my trip. He offers some small breakfast everyday. Dauglas is not at home very often because of his work. There are two subway stations nearby within 10 min walk distance. I would say Dauglas\\' place is very affordable and comfortable to stay.  This property was exactly how it was described on the listing. Douglas went out of his way to make my stay the best it could be with advice, best way to use the subway and a complimentary light breakfast. This place is perfect for a seasoned traveler who is looking for a place to sleep and a hot shower. The room is huge and had plenty of storage and a big screen tv. I was worried about staying in the Bronx, but no one bothered me and the metro ride was only 20 minutes into the city. I\\'d stay here again. The subway station is two blocks away and is manned 24 hours a day.  Douglas is a great host. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. He even bought some breakfast for me and also, provided some useful informations about New York city. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is worthy for your money and I highly recommend it. Just like others said the host is a really nice guy. Provided me the ingredients for breakfasts, provided access to the apartment.\\r\\nThe subway is a couple of blocks away.\\r\\nThe heating system was quite noisy, but the ear plugs solved that problem. I have spent sixs days in the Place of Douglas. The room was like in the pictures and the Location is pretty well connected with the subway. For people with a low budget it\\'s a great place to stay. Besides that, Douglas is a respectful person and provides you a comfortable privacy. I enjoyed the stay. Doug was a great host with a big heart. Unfortunately I only stayed 2 nights with him, but I really enjoyed his company. He was so kind to pick me up from the street, since his place is a little tricky to find. He shared his groceries with me, we had a good conversation and he really was interested in what I was doing and what living in Germany is like. He\\'s open minded and interested in different cultures.\\r\\nHis apartement is very nice. I liked it a lot. No fancy stuff. If you wanna experience hard working, down to earth New York, that\\'s the place to be.\\r\\nI can\\'t say much about the neighborhood. I just went from the subway station to his apartement and back. It\\'s only 5 minutes. The subway will take you in 15 Minutes to Uptown Manhattan.\\r\\nI strongly recommend staying with Doug. First let me say that Douglas is a very kind, friendly and honest person.  I had trouble locating the key, but that kind of thing happens.  Douglas was kind enough to come and meet me and even help with my heavy bag.\\r\\n  He bought rolls for my use in the morning.   The room was fine.  It was large by NY standards, but oh so comfortable.  The pillows and mattress felt better than mine at home. I had complete privacy because I only saw Douglas a couple of times when I needed to convey or receive information. It might not be detailed clean, but it was absolutely passable for the price.  The linens were fresh and adequately available.  There is a nice TV that comes with the room.  It requires a little manipulation of the antennae, but I was able to receive adequate channels and some news.\\r\\n The subway is about 2 blocks away.  You can catch the D train and go all the way downtown without a transfer.  You can catch the D train and go to 125th street for transfer to the M60 bus to Laguardia.  If you are new to NY and going to be there for a few days, I recommend the 7 day unlimited pass.  Feel free to get lost and see all you can see without worry of exact change or taking the wrong train.  Plan 30 minutes to get into Manhattan from  Douglas\\'s stop.\\r\\n  I felt safe in the neighborhood and I visited several of the little markets for coffee and bagles.  There is also a restaurant down the hill called Caridad.  I had a bountiful meal there for $7.99 and it was also very good.  Their fresh orange juice was extreme.\\r\\nI was so glad to have stayed with Douglas.  It allowed me to take full advantage of the city, knowing I had a safe place to return at night and I didn\\'t spend big $$$ for a room that was only used for sleeping and bathing.\\r\\nAfter I left, I realized that I had left my phone in the bedroom and couldn\\'t get back in.  I think Douglas works 12 hours per day.  I called him that night from home in FL.  He generously offered to expedite shipping it to me at no cost.  I hope there is no rule saying you can\\'t tip a host, because he deserves it.\\r\\n This is my second stay at Douglas place and again it was very nice, just like others are saying. He didn\\'t leave feedback, however. Douglas and the apartment were both great! Although I didn\\'t see him often (because I would sleep in and then return late), he was a very courteous host. Every morning I would notice the trash was thrown out, and when I would do the dishes in the morning before leaving and leave them out to dry, I would come back to see that they were already put away. The room was very large, as described in the title and as shown in the photos, and the apartment itself was conveniently located just a few mins walk from 170 St Station on the D and B line, while just around 10 mins walk from Mt Eden Ave Station on the 4 line. Much better choice than an (overpriced) hotel. Overall, it was an amazing first Airbnb experience for me, and I would definitely book with Douglas again! \\xc3\\x93timo anfitri\\xc3\\xa3o!\\r\\nA localiza\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o \\xc3\\xa9 muito boa , na mesma cal\\xc3\\xa7ada do metro,anda apenas um minuto.\\r\\nFiquei muito satisfeito!!!\\r\\n\\r\\n Douglas is very nice and considerate. The room is big, and the bathroom is just next door. A few steps away is the subway station which can directly to to downtown. There are grocery and restaurants nearby. Very convenient! \\r\\n\\r\\n Douglas was a very kind and considered host! The room is spacious, although there isn\\'t that much furniture. There is however a nice t.v. present! We could use the kitchen to store and prepare food, which was handy. The location is rather off-centre, but using the subway the centre could be reached in a reasonable time. This apartment was as described and Douglas was very helpful in providing me with what I needed. I came late the first night and he made sure to help me into my room. Thank you, Douglas!!!\\r\\nYou\\'re an amazing host that allows us leaving our luggage before check-in and after check-out. \\r\\nMy dad,my brother and me were happy staying with you.\\r\\nIt\\'s a very good experience with Douglas.\\r\\n  He was so helpful to me. Everything was perfect. Thanks for having me! The place is in Bronx but no more than 2mins of walk from the metro. Douglas was very helpful and friendly! Douglas is a very kind host! Very welcoming! The place is near a Metro Station and a big boulevard, very nice big room and apartment! Clean! All I needed! It was a very good experience live here. Douglas is a super kind gentleman. The private room is very large and everything is convenient. Douglas is a very kind host, and his flat is located in a large apartment building not far from a metro station in the southern Bronx. The room is surprisingly big, with the window facing the inner yard, which reduces the noise level. There\\'s a kitchen and a bathroom. The visit was very smooth and everything felt very professional.\\r\\nDouglas responds fast to messages; I had to leave the apartment before he returned back from work, and it was easy to arrange a drop-off of the keys -- thanks !\\r\\nFor me as an adult male, I had only positive experiences in the quarter and felt safe. For first-time visitors to NY, do research the location in advance to deciding.\\r\\nI can give my warmest recommendations to Douglas :).  Parempaa ja kiltimp\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4 vuokrais\\xc3\\xa4nt\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4 ei olisi voinut saada. Huolehti siit\\xc3\\xa4 ett\\xc3\\xa4 minulla on aamiaistarpeita j\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4kaapissa ja ett\\xc3\\xa4 kaikki toimi hyvin. Huone oli lupauksen mukaisesti suuri ja siisti. Ilmainen nettiyhteys ja iso tv. En kaipaa matkoillani luksusta, vain hiljaista paikkaa nukkumiseen. Yhteydet kaupungilta hyv\\xc3\\xa4t ja toimivat, l\\xc3\\xa4himp\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4n metroon 300 metri\\xc3\\xa4. Olen \\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4rett\\xc3\\xb6m\\xc3\\xa4n tyytyv\\xc3\\xa4inen valintaani, mik\\xc3\\xa4li olisin majoittunut keskustaan, olisi Bronx koko sen karuudessaan ja kauneudessaan j\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4nyt kokematta. I ace stayed with Douglas once before and it was as before a great experience, allowing me to feel at home from the start; great. S\\xc3\\xa9jour de deux nuit dans l\\'appartement de Douglas dans le Bronx et pour ce prix, rien \\xc3\\xa0 redire ;)\\nChambre spacieuse, internet, cuisine, climatiseur...\\n\\nIn english, perfect for young travellers ! I had a wonderful stay at Douglas\\'s apartment. Doug is a very kind and generous host---he provided everything I needed  and made me feel very welcoming as a guest. The location is pretty good and convenient, too! Highly recommended for all the NYC visitors!  Douglas was a great host. The room is big and has a television and air conditioning. His apartment is clean and close to subway station. It takes around 20 minutes to downtown. I had a good time there. Thank you Douglas! Thanks Douglas, you are such a nice host! I enjoyed my stay very much. The huge room is quiet and comfortable with aircondition. It is only 3 mins away from subway. I live in Berlin, so I had no problems walking around the streets even at night. highly recommendable! Douglas was incredibly kind and generous during my visit and made me feel comfortable and at home. The bed was comfortable, the room was spacious, and it was walking distance to Yankee Stadium! Jeg boede hos Douglas i ca 1 uke. Har kun positivt \\xc3\\xa5 si om oppholdet. Han er en god vert der f\\xc3\\xa5r deg til \\xc3\\xa5 f\\xc3\\xb8le deg hjemme. B\\xc3\\xa5de min ankomst og avgang til NY var litt besverlige pga sene og tidlige tider men Douglas tok dette p\\xc3\\xa5 strak arm og fulgte meg enda til metroen kl 3 om natten. Synes vi fikk god kontakt p\\xc3\\xa5 et mer personligt plan, da Douglas byr p\\xc3\\xa5 seg selv og gj\\xc3\\xb8r netopp airbnb til det perfekte konsept for solo reisende og folk der \\xc3\\xb8nsker mer av sin reise enn et anonymt hotellrom My host made me feel welcome, and reply very fast to any txt; he provided also breakfast for me as cereal, bananas, bagels, jam and coffee/tea. The neighbourhood is predominant hispanic and you get the feeling of the real New York as a multi culture city  Very nice host. We appreciate the breakfast prepared for us. Location is convenient to Metro station. Douglas was an excellent host. He was very friendly and willing to go out of his way to accommodate me during my stay. His apartment is very close to the subways so getting around New York was not a problem. I highly recommend Doug as a host.  Douglas was an excellent host.  The room was very comfortable, and he was very friendly.  I would recommend staying with him to anyone. Douglas was seldom there, but when around he made sure all my needs were met if I had any. The space was clean and quite in my favorite area in the Bronx which is located conveniently between both the 4 and D trains. There\\'s a vizio flat screen tv with cable for your use, a comfy bed, an area to place your clothes and on hot days an a.c. No need to travel far for a bite to eat, shopping or barbers b/c all these things come in abundance on 170st. I had a great time. Great location, and very big room. Douglas was a great host providing breakfast for our mornings. Perfect place to come home to after long day walking around the city. El apartamente est\\xc3\\xa1 muy cerca del metro, que funciona todo el d\\xc3\\xada. La l\\xc3\\xadnea D alcanza el centro de Manhattan en 30 minutos o menos. La l\\xc3\\xadnea 4 se puede tomar a unas 5 cuadras. La habitaci\\xc3\\xb3n es muy amplia, en los d\\xc3\\xadas de calor el aire acondicionado funcion\\xc3\\xb3 perfecto. La cocina est\\xc3\\xa1 equipada en caso de querer cocinar -hay heladera y refrigerador-, y hay lugares para comprar comida y bebida cerca. El ba\\xc3\\xb1o funcionaba perfectamente. Douglas fue muy amable y dejaba frutas y jugos para el desayuno. El barrio era como donde vivo, me sent\\xc3\\xad muy c\\xc3\\xb3modo. Las personas del edificio muy amables. Si vuelvo a NY, seguramente me quede ah\\xc3\\xad de nuevo. The room was very spacious and the localization was great super near the subway stations. Douglas was really great, even bought us fruits and bread for breakfast. We loved the experience of staying there and recommend it to everybody! Thank you Douglas :) Douglas is a very friendly, warmhearted host who helps you with each problem you could have when it\\'s your first trip to the Big Apple. The room is neat and pretty large, the next subway station less than 5min afar. Most things you need for your daily life are just around the corner e.g. super markets, pharmacies, restaurants and a laundrotmat.\\r\\nI can recommend this room to everyone who wants to explore the city (it\\'s just about 20min to Times Square when using the express trains).\\r\\nThanks for everything, Douglas and take care ;D Douglas was a great host, I felt right at home. The room was as described and very comfortable, I would stay here again on my next trip to NYC if it\\'s available.. Douglas was really helpful and I found the apartment no problem, it is very close to the 170 D line subway, and pretty close also to the 4 line. The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, it is really quite big for a room in New York, Douglas left some bananas, bagels and coffee each morning, which was a good way to start the day. Douglas is a great host who graciously accomodated my early arrival time. Room is large and clean. He also provided soap and a towel for showers, bananas and bagels for breakfast. Close to the D and 4 subway lines. There is a decent range of food on East 170th St and E Mt Eden Rd. Good stay overall. Recommended. Douglas is a very nice man with a clean apartment in a nice-looking house. I met him on my arrival and departure and he made sure I had everything I needed - even provided some cereals, bagels and fruits for breakfast. \\nThe room was large, as described, but not as void as the picture suggests: The windows have dark red curtains, there is a big flatscreen TV, a shelf and a couch. The bed is wide, very comfortable and there is a small side table next to it. The bathroom right next door is small but has what you need. Clean towels were provided. \\nThe house is just 3 minutes away from a subway stop, but it takes a while to get to central / lower Manhattan. I felt safe walking to and from the subway stop, even at night.\\nThe apartment smelled like cleaning agents - probably not recommendable for sensitive noses. I did not hear any noise though (stayed Sun-Tue). \\nThe price is unbeatable for what you get. I would stay again! After a difficult task of getting the keys and then scruffy finding the property, Douglas was a great host. Really friendly and welcoming. He provided me with breakfast items and water and left me alone to get on with things.\\r\\nThe apartment is ok. It\\'s certainly not what you\\'d call luxury but for the price it was fine.\\r\\nThe area is what you\\'d expect from the Bronx. I didn\\'t feel too comfortable walking around at night but then I\\'m not used to the area.\\r\\nOnce I\\'d worked out the public transport system it was easy to get in and out of Manhattan - about 30 minutes to downtown - although the trains were very busy.\\r\\nAll in all a cheap and cheerful place to stay when visiting New York. Douglas is a very nice & helpful host. His apartment is clean & short distance to the subway & 30minutes to Time Square. The water heater is an issue as it may turn cold or hot, not easy to adjust to it especially during cold winter. Overall, it is really good to stay with him & will book his place again if we come to New York. Thanks Douglas  Douglas was extremely hospitable and nice. The bedroom was spacious and clean. Clean sheets, towels and blanket. Near to most major subway stations. There were bananas, biscuits and bagels plus coffee for breakfast. Although bronx is a relatively dangerous area, this apartment is on main grand concourse and you should be okay as long as you keep your wits about you and don\\'t do anything stupid.  Douglas was an excellent host.  The bed was comfortable and the place was quiet.  I could come and go as I pleased and the location was very convenient being close to the 4 and the D line.   \\xe6\\x88\\xbf\\xe6\\x9d\\xb1\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe9\\x9d\\x9e\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe5\\xa5\\xbd,\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe6\\x94\\xb9\\xe8\\xa1\\x8c\\xe7\\xa8\\x8b\\xe5\\xb0\\x91\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f\\xe4\\xb8\\x80\\xe5\\xa4\\xa9\\xe4\\xb9\\x9f\\xe9\\x83\\xbd\\xe9\\x80\\x80\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe9\\x8c\\xa2,\\xe6\\x8f\\x90\\xe4\\xbe\\x9b\\xe6\\x97\\xa9\\xe9\\xa4\\x90\\xe8\\xb2\\x9d\\xe6\\x9e\\x9c\\xe8\\xb7\\x9f\\xe8\\x87\\xaa\\xe8\\xa1\\x8c\\xe5\\x8f\\x96\\xe7\\x94\\xa8\\xe4\\xbb\\x96\\xe7\\x9a\\x84\\xe5\\x92\\x96\\xe5\\x95\\xa1\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\xe8\\xa1\\x9b\\xe6\\xb5\\xb4\\xe5\\x85\\xb6\\xe5\\xaf\\xa6\\xe7\\x94\\xa8\\xe5\\x93\\x81\\xe9\\x83\\xbd\\xe5\\xbe\\x88\\xe5\\x85\\x85\\xe8\\xb6\\xb3,\\xe4\\xb9\\x9f\\xe6\\x9c\\x89\\xe4\\xb8\\x80\\xe6\\xa2\\x9d\\xe5\\xa4\\xa7\\xe6\\xb5\\xb4\\xe5\\xb7\\xbe,\\xe4\\xb8\\x8d\\xe9\\x81\\x8e\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe5\\x9b\\xa0\\xe7\\x82\\xba\\xe6\\x94\\x9c\\xe5\\xb8\\xb6\\xe4\\xba\\x86\\xe8\\x87\\xaa\\xe5\\xb7\\xb1\\xe7\\x9a\\x84,\\xe4\\xb8\\x8d\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe4\\xbd\\xbf\\xe7\\x94\\xa8\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\r\\n\\xe6\\x88\\xbf\\xe9\\x96\\x93\\xe4\\xb8\\x80\\xe5\\xa6\\x82\\xe6\\x89\\x80\\xe6\\x8f\\x8f\\xe8\\xbf\\xb0\\xe7\\x9a\\x84\\xe9\\x9d\\x9e\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe5\\xa4\\xa7,\\xe4\\xb8\\x89\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe5\\x85\\xa5\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f\\xe7\\xb5\\x95\\xe5\\xb0\\x8d\\xe6\\xb2\\x92\\xe5\\x95\\x8f\\xe9\\xa1\\x8c,\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe4\\xb8\\x80\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f\\xe7\\x9a\\x84\\xe9\\x9d\\x9e\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe6\\x84\\x89\\xe6\\x82\\x85\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\r\\nBronx\\xe9\\x83\\xbd\\xe6\\x98\\xaf\\xe9\\xbb\\x91\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe5\\xa4\\x9a,\\xe9\\x80\\x99\\xe6\\xa3\\x9f\\xe5\\x85\\xac\\xe5\\xaf\\x93\\xe4\\xb9\\x9f\\xe5\\xa4\\x9a\\xe5\\x8d\\x8a\\xe9\\x83\\xbd\\xe6\\x98\\xaf\\xe9\\xbb\\x91\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe5\\xb1\\x85\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f,\\xe4\\xb8\\x8d\\xe9\\x81\\x8e\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe5\\x80\\x8b\\xe4\\xba\\xba\\xe8\\xaa\\x8d\\xe7\\x82\\xba\\xe4\\xb8\\x8d\\xe7\\x94\\xa8\\xe6\\x93\\x94\\xe5\\xbf\\x83\\xe5\\xae\\xb3\\xe6\\x80\\x95,\\xe5\\x9b\\xa0\\xe7\\x82\\xba\\xe5\\xb0\\xb1\\xe6\\x88\\x91\\xe8\\xa7\\x80\\xe5\\xaf\\x9f\\xe5\\xbe\\x88\\xe5\\xa4\\x9a\\xe6\\x98\\xaf\\xe5\\xae\\xb6\\xe5\\xba\\xad\\xe5\\xbd\\xa2\\xe5\\xbc\\x8f\\xe5\\xb8\\xb6\\xe8\\x91\\x97\\xe5\\xb0\\x8f\\xe5\\xad\\xa9,\\xe4\\xb8\\xa6\\xe4\\xb8\\x94\\xe5\\x85\\xac\\xe5\\xaf\\x93\\xe9\\x9b\\xa2\\xe5\\x9c\\xb0\\xe9\\x90\\xb5\\xe7\\xab\\x99\\xe9\\x9d\\x9e\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe8\\xbf\\x91,\\xe5\\xa4\\x9c\\xe9\\x96\\x93\\xe6\\x99\\x9a\\xe6\\xad\\xb8\\xe4\\xb8\\x8d\\xe7\\x94\\xa8\\xe6\\xad\\xa5\\xe8\\xa1\\x8c\\xe5\\xbe\\x88\\xe9\\x95\\xb7\\xe6\\x99\\x82\\xe9\\x96\\x93\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\xe5\\x85\\xac\\xe5\\xaf\\x93\\xe4\\xbd\\x8d\\xe7\\xbd\\xae\\xe6\\x9c\\x89\\xe5\\x85\\xa9\\xe7\\xb7\\x9a\\xe5\\x9c\\xb0\\xe9\\x90\\xb5\\xe7\\xab\\x99,\\xe5\\x9f\\xba\\xe6\\x9c\\xac\\xe4\\xb8\\x8a\\xe8\\xa6\\x81\\xe5\\x8e\\xbb\\xe6\\x9b\\xbc\\xe5\\x93\\x88\\xe9\\xa0\\x93\\xe9\\x83\\xbd\\xe9\\x9d\\x9e\\xe5\\xb8\\xb8\\xe6\\x96\\xb9\\xe4\\xbe\\xbf,\\xe6\\x9d\\xb1\\xe5\\x81\\xb4\\xe8\\xa5\\xbf\\xe5\\x81\\xb4\\xe5\\x90\\x84\\xe6\\x9c\\x89\\xe5\\x90\\x88\\xe9\\x81\\xa9\\xe7\\x9a\\x84\\xe7\\xb7\\x9a\\xe5\\x8f\\xaf\\xe4\\xbb\\xa5\\xe9\\x81\\xb8\\xe6\\x93\\x87,\\xe5\\x88\\xb0\\xe6\\x9b\\xbc\\xe5\\x93\\x88\\xe9\\xa0\\x93\\xe4\\xb8\\xad\\xe5\\x9f\\x8e\\xe7\\xb4\\x8430-40\\xe5\\x88\\x86\\xe9\\x90\\x98\\xe3\\x80\\x82\\r\\n\\xe7\\x9b\\xb8\\xe7\\x95\\xb6\\xe5\\xa5\\xbd\\xe7\\x9a\\x84\\xe4\\xbd\\x8f\\xe5\\xae\\xbf\\xe9\\xab\\x94\\xe9\\xa9\\x97 Douglas was a great host. The apartments location was strategically located near the subway line. The room was clean, got wifi and huge tv. Good and working bathroom, I just had problem adjusting the shower control both hot and cold but it was just a minor glitch. Got a good breakfast like banana, bread, cereals and coffee. Thank you again Douglas! This place is good and close to the busway station. The building is old enough, though. However, Douglas is friendly and helpful. It\\'s a good place, given the price.  100 % satisfaction. Douglas was very nice, pleasant and communicative. Grand concourse is \"TOP 11-20 NYC must see\", and there is no better way to experience it than staying at Douglas apt. The walk from D line 170st subway stop (NW exit on 171st) is very very short, less than 2 minutes. And I believe that this walk is also safer than most of the Brooklyn as the house is right on the Grand concourse, which is one of those parts of NYC that never sleeps :) This was my best out of 7 different AirBnB experiences in NYC when it comes for value for money, but it had 3 minor downsides compared to other options to stay which I did not mind, but may be worthwhile sharing: 1. it was pretty cold in the room when cold weather came on Jan 4 (I slept well after I put my hoody on, and used my winter jacked as the second blanket), 2. there is mould (black fungus) in the bath which is no problem at all when it comes to hygiene, but mostly a visual problem which some girls and women may however find very disturbing, 3. the choice of take away food and grocery stores is very limited, and surprisingly Bronx is almost as expensive as mid Mahattan in this regards. But for wise travellers who buy the take away food in Brooklyn and eat it in the Sunset park (the best view of Manhattan), and end up their days in NYC on the Times sq., this will be a very pleasant experience especially if travelling before late night hours, as the D train is super fast from Times sq. to Bronx as long as it is on the express track (up to cca. 11pm I guess). I always dreant of staying right on the Grand Concourse, and am very thankful to Douglas for this listing, for being such a pleasant hist and so communicative before my arrival, and for opportunity to finally experience a lot of Bronx - even though I always prefer a different place to stay for a new experience as a solo traveller, when I first come with 1-3 friends Douglases apt. will be the first option whose availability I will check. Great host. Would love being back at Douglas place in NY. Recommend this for short stay in NY. It is great place. The room is so big. Almost four people can sleep in here. And Douglas is so kind and good person. I enjoyed my trip to NYC. \\nDouglas was a very kind and courteous person. \\nThe room was really big, the bed big and it was quite quiet. \\nThe Bronx isn\\'t a bad neighborhood, like it first expected. \\nThe subway is really close and it is a short ride to Manhattan. \\nThanks Douglas. Douglas is charm personified with a welcome smile and a winning room that he generously offers through Airbnb.  This accommodation is in the generous proportions of what I now think of as \\'old NY\\' and, as such, certainly deserves to be cherished.  Certainly I will look forward to a return visit.  Of that there can be no question.  Thanks Douglas for ALL.   Douglas is soooo nice. I love him!!!!  e\\' un  uomo molto generoso  ed ospitale Great place, conveniently located, quiet building, amazing host. \\r\\nHighly recommended if you are looking for a deal. As others have noted, Douglas is very helpful, kind, thoughtful and a great host in all ways. He let me leave my bike at his place for a few extra days and helped me with my bags when I arrived.  Plus it\\'s one of the best deals in New York City.  Douglas was a great host.  The apartment is super close to transit.  Free coffee, bananas, wifi and a big room close to Manhattan; perfect. Great experience all round, place was easy to find with Douglas\\' instructions, he\\'s a very hospitable host and even bought me some fruit which was I was extremely grateful for after my 10 hour train to New York. 10/10 would stay again Bairro muito tranquilo com esta\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o do metr\\xc3\\xb4 ao lado com\\xc3\\xa9rcios bem pr\\xc3\\xb3ximos tamb\\xc3\\xa9m. Douglas is really helpful and will make your trip convenient. The appartment is located 25 mn to Time Square by train. The bedroom is really big (the bed too). The bathroom is acceptable.  In other words, a big deal for a short trip in NYC. Douglas was kind and accommodating.  The listing description was accurate. Great value for a large, private room close to the subway. I would stay again. Douglas is very sweet and accommodating. I felt very safe and comfortable with him. The neighborhood is quiet and his apartment is course to the D And 4 trains. I highly recommend staying here! This has been my second time staying with Douglas, who is a complete gentleman. It felt like coming home to stay with a relative who was seldom there, but always made sure there were fresh fruit and pastries in the kitchen each morning. The picture depicted is exactly what you will get. You\\'ll find a bed, night stand, an a.c unit, flat screen tv and a set of shelves on the wall to place whatever you like or to simply air dry something. The place is nice tidy with a bathroom full of bottled shampoos and soaps if you forgot to bring. The price for what you get is unbeatable. I will have to discuss with my friend about possibly a little decor added to the room which I feel would warm it up a bit and add some color. I grew up in this neighborhood which you will find everything you need and the trains are right outside. Perfect. Gracias a ti Douglas  Douglas is a very nice host, made us feel like home, definetely I would come back to his place when I return to NYC. Douglas is a great host! The room is big and it also has Wifi, big HDTV and Air Conditioner... 30 minutes train from manhattan and the subway station is 2 blocks away... Douglas is rarely at the house so there is a lot of privacy...He cares to have bottled water, muffins, bananas, milk, coffee, bread, so you probably won\\xc2\\xb4t have to worry about breakfast... If you are looking for an affordable place to crash at night, this is a great option! I really enjoyed staying there. It was quiet, safe and clean. Good things about the location:\\n1515 Grand Concourse is pretty convenient, the 4 and D trains take you to middle or lower west Manhattan within 30mins. Pretty good price for an apartment that\\'s not too far off! It is particularly close to the 170th st D train station, just a mere 2 blocks away. There is a large pharmacy, a Subway sandwich store and several other delis/eateries nearby.\\n\\nThis part of the Bronx is very safe. I returned home around midnight with no issues. Lots of families in the area and kids playing out late at 11pm which are good indications of general safety. \\n\\nGood things about host and amenities:\\nDouglas works long hours so he\\'s rarely home during the weekdays. Nevertheless, he is very responsive to requests, and very generous and friendly as a person. Breakfast foods and bottled water are stocked every morning so you don\\'t have to go out for breakfast. You are also free to use the fridge and cook your own food. \\n\\nThe room is very spacious (there\\'s actually space for 2 queen sized beds and then some) and comes with air conditioning and cable TV which was something nice to come home to. Pillows and bedsheets are freshly washed and comfortable. \\n\\nThings to take note of:\\nThe apartment is clean enough for its unbeatable price, but it is not entirely dust/dirt free. Most people don\\'t mind it, I\\'m just highlighting this for individuals, who like me, have sensitive skin, to come prepared. \\n\\nNo washing machine for laundry, although this issue is easily solved by just heading to the nearby laundromats on 170th st.\\n Douglas is a very nice and humble host. He provides AC, TV with cable, Wifi and even coffee and some snacks for breakfast. Neighborhood is lively so you\\'re never walking alone feeling unsafe. The place is a block away from the train station which is incredibly convenient.  He is kind and room is very big and comfortable~ Douglas\\' room is big, relatively comfortable and clean. Don\\'t expect a hotel room, though. It is a nice, cost beneficial place to sleep and not much else. The air conditioning works very well.\\nDouglas is a gentle and reliable person. I had a nice time with him, even if none of us would stay at home during the day.\\nThe apartment is located near a subway station. It is very easy to get to Manhattan from there. The neighborhood itself was of no problem to me, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable to stay outside after night. \\nIn summary, I had a pleasant stay. The room is cheap and access to Manhattan is simple. It\\'s just what I needed as a low budget traveler. Douglas is extremely friendly and considerate. The check in process was very very smooth. His apartment is only a 2 min walk away from the nearest metro station, and felt safe walking at night. The room is very spacious and clean, and the air conditioner worked perfectly in the summer heat! Thank you for your hospitality, Douglas!  Douglas was a very nice host, very helpful and was easy to talk to. His place might not be extravagant but he provided me with a large room with a TV, AC, and a fairly comfortable bed. He provided coffee and some snacks as well. Thank you, Douglas! Douglas was a great host.\\nThe room was as described and pictured.\\nPretty good choice in New York.\\nAbout 35 min to Times Square by subway.\\n Very open and available. I already recommended him to some of my friends. I will be if possible, booking from him again. Thanks Douglas. S\\xc3\\xa9jour de 17 nuits chez Douglas.

The neighborhood is safe, you can walk anywhere, fearless. Douglas is a very nice host. Douglas is a wonderful host.He was waiting for me in his apartment although he had to go somewhere else at the moment of my arrival. The room was clean and had everything needed. AC and wireless Internet and very close to the shops and the subway station. I would definitely go back to his apartment if I ever visit New York again. The room was very large and the accomodations were fine. No living room, small kitchen but with all the necessities. Did not see owner much but he was helpful with everything. Wifi and tv in room work fine. Would recommend. Near subway. I would compare this accommodation to a hotel. The room is big,the bed and mattress were new and there was a TV and WiFi available..  Douglas is a great host,very kind and thoughtful and he had also left us food and water in the kitchen.I can highly recommend this place to everyone and I wish all other host were like Douglas. Everything worked fine.  Douglas welcomed me on arrival and all was easy going.   Douglas is very nice and helpful. The room is very spacious. The only issue I\\'ve had is that the mattress is wrapped in plastic under the bed sheet. It makes noises while I turn in the night. Otherwise, it is a very good stay in this value. Ho alloggiato nell appartamento di Douglas 21 giorni, mi sono trovato molto bene, la camera era grande e spaziosa, letto comodo, TV a schermo piatto 40 pollici, armadio, asse e ferro da stiro, wifi molto veloce. Bagno con doccia Ok. La cucina aveva tutto il necessario, Douglas mi ha sempre fatto trovare dolci o frutta per la colazione, \\xc3\\xa8 una persona molto ospitale, gentile e socievole, per nulla invadente. La metro si trova a 2 minuti dall appartamento e si raggiunge comodamente Manhattan. Zona tranquilla anche a tarda notte, supermercati a 5 minuti a piedi sulla 167th. Lo consiglio a chi cerca un posto tranquillo dove dormire, non lussuoso ma funzionale.  Fresh towels, fresh sheets, our own TV and room. It was everything we needed! Overall decent room. The place is exactly according to the description, the location is good, very close to the train station. Douglas is a very busy person, but always available to help you..  Really great place. Douglas was really kind and also provided breakfast stuff for me. He was generally very helpful and a very kind host.  Douglas\\'s place was great. Quite,calm and very near the subway. He was quite approachable and humble too. Really loved his place and would highly recommend!  It was great, Douglas is very nice and friendly and the room was exactly as in the pictures huge private room,clean and he was approachable at any time Very large room, fast Wifi, clean bathroom, great host. Area gets a little sketchy when dark but I didn\\'t feel unsafe walking alone. Sheets, towels, and breakfast (bananas, tea, instant coffee) provided. I appreciated the access to the kitchen and microwave-- I used the fridge and freezer to store some food as well. Would stay again! Big room close to subway in a nice neighborhood. Douglas is a very friendly host. It is a cozy apartment and very close to the subway. Big room,  very warm, near the subway (D line) and it takes only 30 minutes to Downtown. Excellent wifi and for you ladies there is a hairdryer. Douglas is vey kind and humble. He is so helpful. He sleeps so early as he wakes up very early, so be nice and considerate when you get back to the flat.  As a female I found the bronx different  than other areas but I have to acknowledge it was safe. The bathroom needs to be cleaner , I\\'m talking about the mouldy tiles. The building is rustic, there is a lift that takes you up to the flat on the third floor. I would definitely recommend this place and at this rate it is a bargain.  Douglas was a splendid host who went out of his way to make my stay as comfortable as possible, giving me full access to his kitchen and even providing me with breakfast! The room offered more space than I had imagined possible in New York City. His place is very close to the subway station and the D train is very efficient - I could get to Times Square in half an hour. The nearest subway station doesn\\'t have lifts though, so if you\\'re traveling with a lot of heavy luggage, you might want to get off the subway at 161 Street and Uber over to make your life easier, it should cost less than $10. The neighbourhood was quiet at night but well lit and I had no concerns with safety as a solo female traveler. Overall, I would definitely want to return to Douglas\\'s place some day and visit NYC again :) Was a great place to stay, host is very welcoming and kind. Train stop really close and convenient.  Douglas is such a nice guy and so welcoming and helpful!  He put some things out for breakfast and he even brought me lunch by surprise one day. The room is also huge and the area is pretty quiet and close to the train.  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'Sireesha was a great host! She was very welcoming and made me feel right at home. Before my trip, she was very responsive with communication. The commute into Manhattan was very easy and the D train picks up a short walk away from the building. It was great getting to know her! I thoroughly enjoyed staying with Siree.  Her apartment is clean, comfortable and close to the subway and she went out of her way to make me feel at home.  I now consider Siree a friend and for the price, I can\\'t imagine there is a better option in the NYC area.  Highly recommended! Siree is not just a host but I do consider her a friend, she is very friendly, helpful, good cook :-) I have enjoyed watching a movie with her and her cousin even thou we didn\\'t like the movie \"Lucy\"  much :-)\\n\\nthe house is clean, the living room is spacious, the couch is very comfortable and it\\'s in a safe building few steps away from the subway.\\nShe allowed me to leave my bada at her place when I check out for two days \\nThanks a lot Siree for being such a good person  I have nothing to add to my previous review,\\nWishing you all the best my friend  Siree was a great host. She made me feel welcomed and her very cleaned and nice house, felt like mine. She offered good advice about discovering New York, and chatting with her was allways a real pleasure. The neighbourgh is nice, safe and real. Two different metro are 5 mins away.\\r\\nWhen I\\'ll be back in NY I\\'ll allways see if her place is aveliable.\\r\\n Siree is a very great host!!!! \\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately she offered refreshments and was even willing to give me something to eat from her own fridge. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe space was as mentioned. A couch in her main living space with a view of the city right in front of you. There is a shared bathroom for the apt which serves nicely for the space you are in. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apt is a staff housing apt so many people who work in the hospital live in the building. You will need to be buzzed into the building if arriving after a certain time but this was not a problem.  I felt very welcome!  I was just there for a short time, but Siree was very nice and welcoming!  It\\'s a bit far north, but it\\'s a good deal for the city. Very nice place!  Clean, cozy, you can find all what you need. Siree is cute, friendly and is always ready to help Sireesha was great. She have waited for me to come over to her place even though my flights have kept delaying on me. She has even got me something to eat when I arrived and when I left. I have left early from her place because I have found a place in New York but she was sweet. She is great to talk to and I was very used to her place. I hope to meet her again soon and I would definitely recommend her place.  It was a pleasant stay! Sireesha is very kind person, she helped me a lot! Everything in appartment is comfortabe, especially a couch. Two subway stations is near. I will recommend to stay here!   Sireesha is very helpful, made me feel instantly welcome, kept in contact on arrival for any directions when on route. \\r\\nThis is a great place if ur on a budget or looking for somewhere to kick off from. Its quite a ways uptown but only 2 minutes from the nearest station, 174th on the D. the apt has great shower pressure, gud internet connection, as much chai, tea, coffee as you like.. J\\'ai dormi sur le canap\\xc3\\xa9 (il n\\'est pas convertible, je pr\\xc3\\xa9cise) : elle m\\'a fourni les draps. L\\'accueil a \\xc3\\xa9t\\xc3\\xa9 parfait, tr\\xc3\\xa8s chaleureux.

Thank you Sireesha !! Siree was such a great host. She is really freindly and kind person. She helped me with everything i needed and gave me a great advices and tips about the NYC.  Her apartment is really cozy and clean - it has a great location - metro is about 300m far away. Thank you for the accommodation, I would recommend this place really to everybody. \\r\\nAnd i should not forget to mention that Siree is really great cook, she made a delicious meal - thanks also for that:)  Sireesha is a wonderful person. Really liked the place, easy to Manhattan by train. The couch is very comfortable. Wonderful Stay!  Sireesha ia a great host.  The apartment is clean and in a very convenient location. Highly recommended.  Sireesha was a kind and pleasant host who attended to everything. The space is clean and has plenty of room plus a nice window view over the surrounding area. It\\'s not a wealthy neighborhood and some people may not feel safe on the street at night. I would recommend following Sireesha\\'s directions to reach her apartment via the D train rather than the 4. I had a lovely time staying here in the Bronx with Siree. Siree is so kind and I felt very welcomed and comfortable, she was always happy to answer any questions or help me out in any way.\\r\\nThe commute into Manhattan was easy and the Bronx is a very interesting part of the city too.  Sireesha was an awesome host! I arrived very late but she came right down to welcome me and even fed me since I had not had dinner. The place is cozy, the bed is very comfortable (I knocked out very quickly). I\\'d definitely recommend it if you need to stay a night, it\\'s a great value.  even though it was a short notice, sireesha replied my msg very quickly and allow me to stay her house. she was very welcoming and i had a great staying there. she has a great personality and can get along with people well, so u feel very comfortable around her. thanks for having me and all the best with ur future career! hope ill see ya soon!! This bed is in the living room. It\\'s comfortable and quiet. Host responds very quickly to any texts. I had no trouble walking in late from the B/D line.  Sireesha was very helpful and replied to my request within a short span of time. The house is artistic and has a good (URL HIDDEN) add on , Sireesha  helped me with the places i should visit in NY! - \\r\\nThe neighbourhood is very close to subway station and easily accessible  The host, she\\'s very nice and showed great hospitality. She offered water and food if you need it. As a new-yorker, she\\'d like to offer great advice on where to go, how to go, where to go dinning, etc.\\r\\nThe location was also convenient, very close to metro station and good commuting to downtown manhatten. While I was only there for a short time (just flew in overnight for an interview), I was very happy with my stay. The location was very central at 2 blocks from the metro, and Sireesha was a very kind host. Overall the accommodation was comfortable, and the apartment warm and clean. Couldn\\'t ask for more!

Sireesha was accommodating with my schedule and changes. If your looking for quiet time this is definitely a recommendation  Sireesha is an exceptionally gracious host. She went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed. For example, when I told her I would have to leave very early for a school visit, she offered breakfast and left out bananas an granola bars for me to take with me. When she saw that my blouse was wrinkled, she left out a clothing iron for me to use. She was well informed about NYC and how to get around (provided ample advice about the best trains to take, etc), and she was quite flexible about check-in. Truly kind and accommodating!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is clean, comfortable, and warm in the winter. The shared bathroom is tidy. Although the neighborhood is not the nicest part of the Bronx, the room for rent is located just by a hospital about one short block away from the subway. The streets are fairly well lit even late and night, and I always felt safe even walking to and from the metro entrance. It was quite easy traveling to and from Manhattan. Obviously not luxury accommodations, but Sireesha is very attentive and the photos are accurate (a bright, tidy space). I enjoyed a very pleasant stay. Great value, overall.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI would happily stay with Sireesha again!  Comme decrit, ce logement est tres calme et confortable, ainsi que tres bien situe (a deux minutes a pieds de la station de metro). Nous nous y sommes senties tres bien et notre hote Sireesha a ete adorable avec nous et tres arrangeante. L\\'appartement est propre, lumineux, et le lit confortable. Nous avons egalement apprecie que notre hote nous mette a disposition des serviettes et des draps propres. Sireesha is a very nice host. She was warm, friendly and welcoming. Sireesha es una persona muy amable y tierna. Cuando llegue a su casa inmediatamente ella me mostro el barrio y el supermercado. Es muy Amable, te orienta en la ciudad y ademas es paciente, pues entendida mi pesimo ingles.  I found this place only a few days before I went to New York and I\\'m glad Siresha let me stay there so spontaneously.\\r\\nThe apartment is located in the Bronx, the neighborhood itself is not that pretty but you have a subway station almost right in front of the apartment which takes you to Manhattan in 30 Mins.\\r\\nThe apartment is clean and you\\'ll find everything you need there. Sireesha is so nice and always tries to help you! Sireesha was a very good and accommodating host. She was flexible in what times I was able to check-in and check-out which was very helpful. She had a list of free museum days, an informative new york guide book and just good new york insight on the tourist spots.  She left out some cereal, oatmeal and granola bars for me for breakfast throughout the week, which was very kind! Her shared living space/guest room was clean and a comfortable place to get back to after a long day out. The subway station is a close walk to her building, and I always felt safe no matter what time I was coming back. D-train is an express and gets to Manhattan in about 20-25 mins and has stops along most tourist spots. I spent a great couple of days at Sireesha\\'s place. It was clean and comfortable, and she treated me to delicious Indian food and a Bollywood film. I wish we had gotten more time to hang out. Sireesha, you are welcome in Colorado any time! :) Sireesha is awesome! Very friendly and accomodating. Great apt, easy to commute.  \\xec\\xb2\\xab \\xeb\\x82\\xa0 \\xea\\xb8\\xb8\\xec\\x9d\\x84 \\xed\\x97\\xa4\\xeb\\xa9\\x9c \\xeb\\x95\\x8c \\xec\\xb9\\x9c\\xec\\xa0\\x88\\xed\\x95\\x98\\xea\\xb2\\x8c \\xeb\\xa7\\x88\\xec\\xa4\\x91\\xeb\\x8f\\x84 \\xeb\\x82\\x98\\xec\\x99\\x80\\xec\\xa3\\xbc\\xea\\xb3\\xa0, \\xec\\xa7\\x91\\xeb\\x8f\\x84 \\xec\\xa1\\xb0\\xec\\x9a\\xa9\\xed\\x95\\x98\\xea\\xb3\\xa0 \\xea\\xb9\\xa8\\xeb\\x81\\x97\\xed\\x95\\x98\\xeb\\x8b\\xa4. Great, stress free experience. We are thankful for Sireeshas hospitality! Apartment was cozy and clean. We had enaugh privacy even the room was shared room, also it was really nice to have some evening conversations with you! :) Sireesha gave us useful information about metro in NY, visitable places, etc. And metro station was only few steps away from home! \\r\\nThank you for everything! Sireesha was an excellent host who made us feel welcome in her home. This listing was as described - clean and comfortable. Sireesha went out of her way to provide amenities such as snacks, breakfast etc to make our stay that much easier. We highly recommend staying here.  Sireesha was such an accommodating, helpful, and gracious host. She responded to all of my messages almost instantly, was incredibly respectful, and went out of her way to make me feel comfortable, safe, and welcomed into her apartment in the Bronx. Staying with Sireesha was simply a breeze; I know that I made the perfect decision by staying with her for my trip to NYC. The travel from Manhattan to the Bronx was effortless as Sireesha made sure that I knew exactly how to navigate around the city without a worry at all. I will definitely stay with her again when I return to New York City. Thank you so much for making my first experience on AirBnb a fabulous one!  I honestly booked my airbnb with Sireesha mainly because of her AMAZING reviews. She was really respectful of my space- made me know that this was \\'my space\\' too, her apartment was really tidy and kept an eye out for me since I just moved to NY. Good conversation, warm hostess and respectful of privacy. Sireesha exceeded my expectations as an airbnb host.  Thank you Sireesha for your hospitality! The apartment was clean and I had enaugh privacy. The metro station was really nearby! We absolutely loved staying at Sireesha\\'s place! She made us feel so welcomed at her place, even coming out to greet us in the beginning. The place was very neat and comfortable, perfect size for two people. When my shoes broke, she even graciously let me borrow a hot glue gun! That was a lifesaver, thank you! Her place is close to the train station, about a 2-3 minute walk, which was very convenient! Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay, and I absolutely recommend everyone to stay with Sireesha! This has to be the best deal to stay in NYC. It is extremely comfortable, neat and clean, and the hostess, Sireesha, is absolutely wonderful. Yup, this is The Bronx- but you get to Manhattan in approximately half hour! I stayed at Sireesha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place for a week and I felt as comfortable as being in my own place. You not only get a bed to crash in, but an entire, very cool, space. She knows when to give you your space and when to provide useful information. Had it not been for Sireesha, I would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent loads of cash on Uber/Taxi. She gave me tips on how to use public transportation and the different subway lines close to her apartment- like a 3 minute walk. She would offer breakfast, dinner. Her cooking is AMAZING. The apartment is extremely clean as Siree loves to clean and keeps everything pretty and tidy. The bed is so comfortable that I would sleep-in often. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great desk with a desktop computer and printer. A nice view. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in NYC for motives other than touristing around (i.e., you have to work on something) the room is very bright due to the massive windows that pour light from outside (if the shades are open) and also bright lights inside the place. The library is right across- but Sireesha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place is more comfortable. It is so cozy and artsy with fast and reliable wi-fi. Sireesha makes sure to give you privacy, but is also readily accessible if you need anything. She will not hesitate to offer you anything she can provide. If I was on my phone, she would place a nice, warm cup of chai next to me. She really makes you feel like her place is also yours and always carries a positive attitude and vibe, a smile on her face and is never grumpy or odd. She readily offers any information or answers to questions you may have. She loves NYC and is very knowledgeable about it- take advantage of this. It was a wonderful experience and I really enjoyed it. I could not have asked for a better host or place. I was so lucky to find this place while interviewing for an entire week in NYC. It exceeded my expectations. Thanks, Sireesha! You were an essential component for my interview season and words can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t express how thankful I am to you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re awesome. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ever in Rochester or DR, my doors are open to you.  \\r\\n This was my first time using Airbnb, in addition to being my first time in NY. All of the positive reviews of Sireesha\\'s place are spot on!! She was very welcoming and made me feel right at home!! Even though it took awhile for my cab to get to her place, she waited to welcome me in and made sure I wasn\\'t lost. Her place was very clean, and she gave me just the right amount of privacy I needed too. If I\\'m ever back in the area, I would definitely book here again! It was a great first time experience using Airbnb. Thank you Sireesha! I arrived so late at Sireesha\\'s place that I can not say it. However she has been welcoming me very nicely and make me at ease. I did not have the chance to see her during all my stay but I knew I could ask to her any support.\\r\\nHer place is super close to the subway or train, very comfortable to move to Manhattan! It is also very clean and nice.\\r\\nTo finish, thank you for the Dosa crepes, I have really appreciated.  It was my first visit to NYC and I had lot of apprehensions as I was booking a place at the last minute. I started off my messaging her asking her I must say a LOT of questions . But she was really patient and clarified alley queries and put me at ease. She even called me to check my time of arrival and advised on how to get to her place .\\nUnfortunately I didn\\'t get to see her during most of my stay but she always texted me to make sure I was okay. That\\'s the sweetest thing anyone !\\nThanks Sireesha for everything .  Sireesha was a great host! She was extremely respectful and welcoming, but allowed me to feel like I had my own space at the same time. I had a really great experience and it was my first time in the Bronx. Hope to be able to stay there again if I go back! Sireesha is the perfect host! I felt very welcome in this lovely and well kept apartment. The listing description is very accurate, it\\'s quiet and the commute is easy. \\r\\nThank you for having me :)  Sireesha was a good host - respectful, responsive, friendly. Subway is close. Apartment is clean. I would stay there again.  Sireesha\\xe2\\x80\\x98s place turned out to be perfect for what I was looking for for my visit to NYC. Sireesha herself is very responsive, helpful and welcoming. She is great with ideas and suggestions on what to do in NY and surroundings, where to get groceries and what mobile plan to get. Her apartment is clean and tidy, light and bright - and also just as described. I loved the view from her apartment especially at night.\\r\\nShireesha tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible. The living room is quite spacious. Also, there is enough space for clothes, shoes and books. She provided a closet, chairs, bedside-type table, desk, lamp and hangers. The shared bathroom and also the kitchen were kept very clean. Sireesha shared the fridge with me and I could use all her dishes. \\r\\nLocation-wise, it\\'s a short ride downtown with number 4 or D straight and trains run regularly. As everywhere, if you don\\'t have to, don\\'t walk the streets alone at night. Since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close to the hospital there is extra security and in the daytime I always felt safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I felt very comfortable and from the first day on Sireesha gave my the feeling that her home is my home as well. Sireesha est une h\\xc3\\xb4te agr\\xc3\\xa9able. L\\'appartement est bien tenu et le quartier s\\xc3\\xbbr.  Sireesha is very welcoming and makes sure that you are comfortable. She is willing to help if you are unsure of things to do around the area! She\\'s wonderful! Sireesha is very accommodating and her apartment is very cozy and clean. Very close to the subway, which makes it easy to get around.  Super exp\\xc3\\xa9rience avec Sireesha ! Logement propre, calme, situ\\xc3\\xa9 pr\\xc3\\xa8s d\\'une station de m\\xc3\\xa9tro (45 min pour rejoindre le centre de Manhattan). Malgr\\xc3\\xa9 la r\\xc3\\xa9putation du quartier, nous ne nous sommes jamais sentis en danger. \\r\\nSireesha est tr\\xc3\\xa8s sympathique et tr\\xc3\\xa8s accueillante ! Tr\\xc3\\xa8s bon rapport qualit\\xc3\\xa9-prix.\\r\\nLogement \\xc3\\xa0 recommander ! Sireesha was a very accommodating host. She was prompt in person and in replying to messages. She was very pleasant and thoughtful; when we arrived  on a hot day she had cold drinks ready for us. All amenities were as described, the bed was comfortable and the sofa even more so. The subway was 1 minute away and you could be at times square in 30 minutes. An all around pleasant stay! This was my second stay with Airbnb and it was truly perfect. Sireesha was very welcoming, her place looked exactly like in the pictures, it had a cozy home-kind-of feel, I felt very comfortable and safe, the location was great and the whole experience couldn\\'t have been better. I would definitelly stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in NYC. Sireesha is very nice and accommodating host. She helped us a lot by not having and demands and by being completely flexible regarding the time schedule. I really have nothing to complain about and can only recommend.\\r\\n I stayed at Sireesha\\'s place for 2 nights. She is very kind, i was with a cold and she helped me, she is a doctor. The area is ok, is a safe place and you can find many stores 1 block from the apartment as well as the metro stop.'}]"
