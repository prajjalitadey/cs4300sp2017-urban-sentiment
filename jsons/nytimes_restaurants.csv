ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs not.Franklin Barbecue,Austin,Austin Tex.,When you finally reach the front of the line at Franklin Barbecue you're asked how much brisket you want.

Under their gaze the waiter brings plates of ema datse the Bhutanese daily meal of chiles and cheese; earthy red rice from high elevations in the Paro Valley; and black tea churned forever with salt and a pat of butter.

They focus on the kind of unshowy full-flavored dishes that are the running stitch of a Thai childhood. This is food as balm for the homesick speaking directly to the Thai immigrants who live in the neighborhood Í¢‘„‘î although all are welcome.White Gold Butchers,New York,Upper West Side,In this restaurant inside a butcher shop the menu gets right to the point no small talk. The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them grilled very simply for dinner.

The old regulars would have taken one look at the new menu and called for another shot but the cooking is exciting; some of it even resembles bar food.F.O.B.,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,The chef Armando Litiatco was born in the Philippines and grew up in Daly City Calif. which has the countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs highest concentration of people of Filipino descent. Here he serves delicate versions of classic Filipino dishes in a gracious dining room with roomy chairs and light bulbs that rest like cockatoos in wrought-iron bird-cage lanterns. Food comes on grandmotherly mismatched china; family members beam from framed photos.Fowler &amp; Wells,New York,Financial District,Tom Colicchio the chef and owner tries to bring some Gilded Age exuberance to this restaurant in a restored 1883 building. Many of the components including the cocktails wine list and desserts are excellent. But in the menu and the dÍ—‘©cor the central vision is fuzzy and the restaurant is somehow less than the sum of its parts.Lhasa Fast Food,Queens,Jackson Heights,Once Lhasa Fast Food was just a counter at the back of a cellphone store; now it has its own door at the end of a narrow corridor flanked by jewelers. For some diners the more tortuous the journey the more miraculous the meal. But the cooking here Í¢‘„‘î cauldrons of dusky broths heavy with hand-torn scraps of dough and humming with Sichuan peppercorns; momos looking ready to burst their pleats Í¢‘„‘î would be worth seeking out even if it were served in a sleek food hall in Midtown Manhattan.Ichiran,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Ichiran a Japanese ramen chain makes one kind of soup the opaque ivory pork broth called tonkotsu. But it presents a boggling number of choices starting with whether to sit at a table or in one of the Í¢‘„‘ñflavor concentration booths.\u201dVery Fresh Noodles,New York,Chelsea,Í¢‘„‘ñBiang biang\u201d is both the name of the noodles stretched to order at this cramped corner stall in Chelsea Market Í¢‘„‘î straps of dough as wide as a belt drawn out to the wingspan of their maker Í¢‘„‘î and the sound of them snapping against the counter. TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre at once elastic and dense and too long to fish out of the soup whole; you must pray a little bowing your head to eat. Too bad thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs nowhere to sit. Smart diners come early and grab one of the two windowsills although eating is still a precarious business.Flora Bar,New York City,Upper East Side,Flora Bar inside the Met Breuer is less a restaurant than a wine bar with small tidily formal plates and a drinks list as exhaustive as any artistÍ¢‘„‘Žs career retrospective.Karu CafÍ—‘©,Queens,Woodside,In this unassuming storefront two chefs cook side by side one from Paraguay the other from Venezuela: harmony between otherwise quarreling nations. Venezuelan arepas airy corn cakes barely a fingerÍ¢‘„‘Žs width thick may share the table with Paraguayan chipas dense bulging curls of cassava flour and cornmeal fattened by cheese eggs milk and butter and tasting like gougÍ—‘Îres after a gravitational collapse. Karu means Í¢‘„‘ñto eat\u201d in GuaranÍ—‘_ the indigenous language written into ParaguayÍ¢‘„‘Žs Constitution as equal to Spanish defying the legacy of the conquistadors.Locol,Bronx,Oakland,The chefs Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi are trying to do so many things with their insurgent fast-food chain Locol that it almost has to fall short somewhere. What is surprising though is that they would have so much trouble with the food.The Odeon,New York,TriBeCa,The kitchen retrenched years ago to a comfortably broken-in lineup of French and American standards. Cooking like this is sometimes called comfort food but a better word for the menu and everything else about the Odeon is restorative.Cut by Wolfgang Puck,99 Church Street,Financial District,Wolfgang PuckÍ¢‘„‘Žs hotel steakhouse his first venture in Manhattan felt dated as soon as it opened.

ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs as if youÍ¢‘„‘Žd popped through a trap door into a secret clubhouse.

Unlike with traditional Sichuan hot pot here the chef unseen flips your chosen items in a wok with a philter of chile and spice. They materialize before you in a woven wooden bowl like a dangerous salad. Four levels of Í¢‘„‘ñspiciness\u201d are on offer; even a veteran fire-eater neednÍ¢‘„‘Žt go past three.Bad Saint,Washington D.C.,Washington D.C.,Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage not to handle the pressure of being one of WashingtonÍ¢‘„‘Žs most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both because the food prepared under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins youÍ¢‘„‘Žve had with Filipino food.Mumbai Xpress,Queens,Floral Park,Other places in town serve chaat a vast genre of Indian snacks fueled by salt and tang but perhaps none with the same range and single-minded devotion. Hina Shah the chef opened Mumbai Xpress with her husband Mahendra after relatives and friends insisted that her cooking was too good to keep in her home kitchen. The menu is proof for their argument with vivid offerings that hark back to the chaatwallahs of Chowpatty Beach and Breach Candy in Mumbai and testify to the wisdom of a culture that respects snacks makes them by hand and gives them nuance layers and colliding flavors.Alimentos Saludables,Brooklyn,Sunset Park,This Mexican diner serves some of the best tamales in town slapped on a paper plate and trussed in corn husks still damp with steam. Unshucked they seem almost to breathe. The dough is soft and marbled with sauce so that a little finds its way into every bite. ConcepciÍ—‘_n Gonzalez the chef who started out selling tamales in front of a nearby church is an efficient motherly presence. A statue of baby Jesus in gold robes gazes pacifically from a glass case; HÍ—‘©ctor Acosta might be singing merengue on the jukebox. The menu lists five varieties of tamales most of which will be sold out by dinnertime so come early.Fish Cheeks,New York,NoHo,Specializing in a small number of seafood dishes from around Thailand Fish Cheeks is not a groundbreaking experiment; it simply cooks the way more Thai kitchens should.Thursday Kitchen,New York,East Village,Thursday Kitchen has more interesting cooking than you might expect from a restaurant that serves illuminated cocktails in plastic bags like debauched Capri Suns. Kyungmin Kay Hyun the chef a native of South Korea ferments her own ponzu for 30 days to accompany her exemplary pajeon (scallion pancake); pairs charred octopus with a chardonnay gelÍ—‘©e and a Korean barbecue-like tincture of soy scallions and Asian pear; and tempers crispy pork belly with white kimchi so called because itÍ¢‘„‘Žs made without chile privileging funk over heat.TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie,New York,Union Square,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs now easier to find a ramen shop in Manhattan than a mailbox but udon specialists are rare.

Guests are given 30 minutes to dine; the clock starts at reservation time. This might seem ruthless but the price is kind: $50 for 12 pieces of beautifully fresh fish. The menu reads like a classic-rock playlist Í¢‘„‘î hamachi salmon tuna Í¢‘„‘î but there are surprises like scallop with smoky black salt and uni draped over seared wagyushu beef.The Beatrice Inn,Manhattan,West Village,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs called a chophouse but the Beatrice Inn is not a place for cautious eaters seeking refuge from the unknown. The menu almost entirely devoted to meat is an opportunity to take chances and eat with abandon.Great Northern Food Hall,New York,Midtown East,ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs something utopian about the notion that even a hasty inconsequential meal gobbled on a train or at a desk can be Í¢‘„‘î should be Í¢‘„‘î fresh and good. ThatÍ¢‘„‘Žs the mission of this impeccably polished food hall opened in Grand Central Terminal by the Danish restaurateur Claus Meyer a founder of Noma in Copenhagen and a prime mover in defining New Nordic cuisine. Almost every bite here is vivid comforting and at times even profound.Karasu,New York,Fort Greene,Karasu is a speakeasy behind the back wall of a corner tavern.

The second is that itÍ¢‘„‘Žs so polished and considered.Zadie's Oyster Room,New York,East Village,Zadie's is devoted to the oyster in all its edible forms: raw of course but also baked broiled poached in a cream-sherry sauce even pickled.Pondicheri,New York,NoMad,There isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt another restaurant in the city quite like Pondicheri where from breakast through dinner the flavors of India are imported into American daily life.The Chinese Club,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,The Chinese Club looks like a straightforwardly (if self-consciously kitschy) Chinese restaurant. But the food is as Chinese as General TsoÍ¢‘„‘Žs chicken Í¢‘„‘î diaspora cuisine filtered through another nationÍ¢‘„‘Žs consciousness in this case IndiaÍ¢‘„‘Žs. This means Chinese five-spice dusted alongside Indian chaat masala. and liberal slugs of soy and ketchup. One menu item comes with the warning Í¢‘„‘ñNot what you think\u201d and this could apply to almost every dish in ways that sometimes charm and sometimes baffle. These may be dishes that require the halo of nostalgia.Carla HallÍ¢‘„‘Žs Southern Kitchen,Brooklyn,Columbia Street Waterfront District,In a small casual corner spot Carla Hall a host of Í¢‘„‘ñThe Chew\u201d pays tribute to the menacingly spicy fried chicken of PrinceÍ¢‘„‘Žs and other places in Nashville.Joy Luck Palace,New York,Chinatown,Every day hundreds of dumplings buns dense turnip cakes slippery cheong fun and plates of tripe and chicken feet are wheeled around a dining room that would dwarf some nationsÍ¢‘„‘Ž airports. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a wonder that anything makes it unsnatched to the far side of the room but somehow the dim-sum cart ladies manage it like Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes. Much of the food Í¢‘„‘î classics like stuffed bitter melon alongside faddishly cute pig-shaped custard buns Í¢‘„‘î is good if not transcendent and the range is thrilling. Expect a long wait and mayhem.Sauvage,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,At its best Sauvage seems to be on to something exciting a combination of European kitchen discipline and a gut instinct for meeting the appetite head on.Tong Sam Gyup Goo Yi,Queens,Flushing,In Korean pork belly is called samgyupsal or three-layer flesh a name at once poetic and literal. At this barbecue restaurant itÍ¢‘„‘Žs marinated for three days in doenjang (fermented soybean paste) which deepens the porkÍ¢‘„‘Žs natural sweetness without eclipsing it. The gleaming black grill plate on each table mimics the lid of a traditional Korean cauldron allowing the porkÍ¢‘„‘Žs drippings to run down into the wreath of bean sprouts kimchi and garlic cloves snapping on the hot iron below.2nd City,New York,West Village,At this Filipino-leaning taqueria the chef Jordan Andino turns lumpia wrappers into chips for dunking in suka (spiced vinegar his grandmotherÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipe); anoints tacos with sinigang a tangy tamarind soup; and otherwise makes what he calls Í¢‘„‘ñAmAsian\u201d or American-Asian food Í¢‘„‘î more general than specific. The restaurant feels like an extension of his exuberant personality: Í¢‘„‘ñHours of Awesomeness\u201d are posted on the window the staff wear aloha shirts and menu items are written on skateboards the chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs primary mode of transportation.GÍ—‘_nter Seeger NY,New York,West Village,GÍ—‘_nter Seeger who made his name in Atlanta in the 1990s and 2000s is a deeply expressive chef Í¢‘„‘î expressive of the season and of his own focused disciplined style.

The Tex-Mex side is more distinct with flour tortillas made daily by hand and queso fervent with cumin and Hatch green chiles.

Now the only trace of the Mediterranean is a pink sauce of tomatoes and heavy cream ladled over momos Himalayan dumplings. The rest of the menu is true to the roof of the world: gossamer flakes of beaten rice; small whole fish deep-fried and meant to be eaten bones and all; and rice-flour crepes under a rubble of meat which some may consider an improvement on pizza.Cassia,Santa Monica,Santa Monica Calif.,One of the most appealing things about Cassia is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines (Vietnamese in particular) that inspire much of the menu.Tsion Cafe,New York,Harlem,Beejhy Barhany the chef was born in northern Ethiopia into a community of Beta Israel as Ethiopian Jews are known. When she was 4 her family fled on foot to Sudan and eventually made its way to Israel.

The dough is sweet and thick as chewy as an underbaked cookie. Most important it is filled with a soupy stew cooked for days and lush with broken-down cowÍ¢‘„‘Žs foot that threatens to gush at first bite. It is as satisfyingly sweet-and-salty as someone up at 2 a.m. and starving would wish.Bohemian Spirit,New York,Yorkville,At this Czech restaurant on the ground floor of the 120-year-old Bohemian National Hall the mission is nostalgic nourishment.

It springs from a sense of safety and reassurance that is kept vital by acts of imagination.Olmsted,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,Not much about the dining room sets Olmsted apart from any number of other new places to eat. But the quail coop and crayfish tub in the backyard and the thoughtful inventive food coming out of the tiny kitchen tell you that hidden inside this simple and affordable neighborhood restaurant is another more unusual one waiting to get out.Agern,New York,Midtown East,Agern feels like a quiet harbor away from the eddies and currents of Grand Central Terminal. In the modern Scandinavian dining room pale wood charcoal seat cushions and wall tiles in mossy Grand Central green create a calming mood.

The front side of the menu devoted to brunch dishes of almost Californian lightness is hers; the thrill is the hidden tracks listed on the back as Í¢‘„‘ñethnic plates\u201d Í¢‘„‘î Mr. GyaltsenÍ¢‘„‘Žs contribution from the hometown he had to leave behind.Pasquale Jones,New York,Little Italy,The menu flits from pizza to pasta to the inevitable small plates to a rib-eye for two; most of the food is cooked in wood-burning ovens; and the noteworthy wine list roams beyond Italy and offers bottles that used to be considered too good for a pizza parlor.Beach Bistro 96,Queens,The Rockaways,Carlos Vallera who grew up in the Brazilian port town Santos opened this low-slung sea shack a block from Rockaway Beach after another life as a pro surfer and model. The menu is modest and mostly snacks like a chewy moon-white crepe of tapioca pearls and pÍ—‘£o de queijo Brazilian cousins to French gougÍ—‘Îres barely-there puffs like held breaths with implosions at the center. Banana trees crowd the wallpaper and a surfboard leans in a corner although not one of Mr. ValleraÍ¢‘„‘Žs: Those belong to the waves.Burma Noodle Bar,Brooklyn,Sunset Park,Eugene Saw the son of Burmese immigrants started out selling laphet thoke (fermented-tea-leaf salad) and sugarcane juice hand-cranked on an iron press at Smorgasburg.

Portions are generous prices kind and the menu mostly reassuring to those unfamiliar with the cuisine. At times the cooking can seem distracted Í¢‘„‘î Mr. Imperial also manages the grocery and a food truck Í¢‘„‘î but his kaldereta a dark tomato stew of goat shank long braised with manzanilla olives and liver pÍ—‘¢tÍ—‘© is beautiful. FreekÍ¢‘„‘Žs Mill,Brooklyn,Gowanus,FreekÍ¢‘„‘Žs Mill looks not very different from other young ingredient-minded Brooklyn restaurants. But the wine list is wonderfully eccentric heavily weighted with chenin blanc and gamay. These wines are flexible wrapping themselves around whatever you happen to be eating. This is lucky because so many things on Chad ShanerÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu are worth trying.The Crabby Shack,Brooklyn,Crown Heights,At this airy temple to crab framed in white and sea blue there are no whole crabs in buckets no butcher paper on the tables. But almost everything on the menu is a tribute to the crustacean: legs and claws steamed given a bath in beer and Old Bay and presented in a plastic bag with an alchemy of butter and garlic; merus meat from the fattest part of the leg crowded into a MartinÍ¢‘„‘Žs potato roll or stacked with bacon and avocado on Texas toast. Names of people who contributed funds to the opening of the restaurant are painted by the front door with a note of gratitude: Í¢‘„‘ñThe greatest gift of life is friendship.\u201dDistrict Saigon,New York,Astoria,At this restaurant run by a Vietnamese-born father and his American-raised son the pho is clear but lush on the tongue delicate and substantial at once. Its depth is something of a surprise given other offerings that seem slightly canted to please American palates favoring the caramel that underlies many Vietnamese dishes. Still the kitchen is attentive to ingredients and the space a former 99-cent store is a beautiful sprawl of live-edge wood tables with a mantra on the back wall which translates: Í¢‘„‘ñItÍ¢‘„‘Žs great to be together.\u201dGrÍ—‘_nauer Bistro,New York,Upper East Side,Although it opened in early March it might have been frying Wiener schnitzel and simmering tafelspitz on the corner of First Avenue and 82nd Street for decades.Caridad China,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,At this restaurant on BrooklynÍ¢‘„‘Žs Avenue of Puerto Rico Billy Li a native of Guangdong China who spent most of his life in Puerto Rico crushes plantains in a mortar then heaves shrimp into a giant wok. As at other Chino Latino restaurants in New York City no cross-pollination of seasonings is allowed only congenial cohabitation on the table. The Chinese dishes are truer to the Chinese restaurants of 1980s America than to China which means everything has a slightly caramel edge as if Americans were children in constant need of dessert. Somehow this doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt feel like scorn; it feels like kindness.Le Coq Rico,New York,Flatiron,A branch of a Parisian Í¢‘„‘ñbistro for beautiful birds\u201d founded by the chef Antoine Westermann Le Coq Rico is the perfect place to take people who believe they can make a better roast chicken at home.B &amp; K French Cuisine,New York,Harlem,Benjamin Baccari Kebe the owner and chef of this tiny Harlem storefront began his life in the kitchen at the age of 15 at Restaurant Alain Ducasse at the Plaza AthÍ—‘©nÍ—‘©e Paris. He brings classical French technique to a simple gently priced menu braising beef for four to five hours just for a sandwich and making fish and chips with a batter so buoyant it looks like armored air.La Sirena,New York,Chelsea,La Sirena has two dining rooms connected by a bar with the approximate dimensions of a jet runway. It's so large that somebody is always on the move. That perpetual motion supplies a lot of La SirenaÍ¢‘„‘Žs energy; the rest comes from the dressy trattoria cooking.Mr. DonahueÍ¢‘„‘Žs,New York,Nolita,Mr. DonahueÍ¢‘„‘Žs summons up a lost world of roast beef honest-to-goodness gravy side dishes that sit in their own wells on sectioned plates and an atmosphere that seems unpremeditated.Nabaya,Bronx,Melrose,At this West African restaurant run by a native of Guinea alongside cooks from Ivory Coast and Senegal the menu is best understood as a wish list. Only a few dishes are ever available but they are worth it: by day stews briny with smoked fish and crawfish powder; by night large single-minded plates of meat needled with Scotch bonnets. The facade may be lit up in neon but the dining room is drowsy.Ruffian Wine Bar &amp; ChefÍ¢‘„‘Žs Table,New York,East Village,The scope of the wine list and the inventiveness of the cooking are among the more impressive feats pulled off by this narrow sliver of a wine bar.Indian Accent,New York,Midtown,A Midtown branch of an acclaimed restaurant in New Delhi Indian Accent feeds the desire to see traditional cuisine twisted bent and played with.King of Falafel &amp; Shawarma,Queens,Astoria,For 14 years Fares Zeideia known as Freddy plied a street cart on the corner of Broadway and 30th Street in Astoria Queens clad in billowy pants with look-at-me prints calling his customers by name and handing out free falafel like alms. At his first bricks-and-mortar restaurant the falafel and shawarma are as great as they ever were served in a dining room decorated in bright red and green to keep the atmosphere Í¢‘„‘ñnot too official.\u201dMomofuku Nishi,New York,Chelsea,David ChangÍ¢‘„‘Žs alleged foray into Italian flavors takes place in an unpleasantly loud and uncomfortable room.Taiwan Bear House,New York,Chinatown,At Taiwan Bear House in Chinatown biodegradable wooden boxes are packed with rice minced pork simmered down to a near gravy garlicky cabbage half a soy-dark egg and a dense square of dry tofu then topped with a thin crusty pork chop slabs of pork belly or chicken twice fried in the night-market style. They are stubbornly unfancy and in no need of elevation.AngelaÍ¢‘„‘Žs,Brooklyn,Bedford Stuyvesant,Growing up in Guyana Angela Pellew-Whyte watched her father prepare holiday feasts for his nine children and the sprawling families of his six brothers and two sisters. At her namesake restaurant due north of some of the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs more celebrated Trinidadian roti and doubles shops she presents pan-Caribbean dishes Í¢‘„‘î saltfish and bake curry goat a profound oxtail stew Í¢‘„‘î under a wooden chandelier as what sounds like one eternal song loops from the speakers.CafÍ—‘© Altro Paradiso,New York,SoHo,A fantasy on the theme of a simple Italian cafe; the food can look and sound ordinary but is often anything but.AntonÍ¢‘„‘Žs Dumplings,New York,West Village,Anton Yelyashkevich who was born in Minsk Belarus and grew up in Bensonhurst Brooklyn designed this food cart with the white red and black color scheme of a Soviet propaganda poster. His dumplings are small but robust made by hand from Mr. YelyashkevichÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipe at a pelmeni factory in Brooklyn with skins that are thin but strong enough to survive a bout in boiling water and a quick press and scrape over a flat-top grill.Chaiwali,New York,Harlem,On two lovingly decorated floors of a Harlem brownstone this restaurant serves the relaxed light-handed modern food that Americans with roots in India may cook at home.El Molcajete,Bronx,Soundview,From downtown Manhattan El Molcajete is not much farther than the late-night taco trucks on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens or the taquerias of Bushwick and Sunset Park Brooklyn and as serious a destination. Tacos here can barely hold their chubby fistfuls of meat: hanks of shredded barbacoa dark and caramelly cecina cabeza more a stage of melt than flesh. Little English is spoken; the staff is cooking for and serving the neighborhood.Bite of Hong Kong,New York,Chinatown,The trappings are classic at this Cantonese restaurant: great round banquet tables draped in red tablecloths lazy Susans making idle revolutions and a wall of tanks stocked with faintly prehistoric fish. The menu is at once too vast and too pithy but if you study it long enough you will find dishes that speak to both the elegance and motley of eating in Hong Kong.Salvation Burger,New York,Midtown East,At Salvation Burger the chef April Bloomfield zeroes in on what the people want and dispenses with almost everything else; three of the five main courses are burgers and all five come on a bun.The Spotted Pig,New York,West Village,April Bloomfield and Ken FriedmanÍ¢‘„‘Žs tchotchke-filled gastropub is hugely influential and enduringly popular.BK Jani,Brooklyn,Bushwick,At this small Pakistani barbecue spot the beef lamb and chicken are pasture-raised and hormone-free and come from Pat LaFrieda although that only partly explains their blackened magic. Sibte Hassan the chef and owner is a Midas of meat which he serves at picnic tables on paper plates with no utensils in homage to the street food of his childhood in Lahore.I Sodi,New York,West Village,To eat at I Sodi is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi the chef and an owner brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised.Le Turtle,New York,Lower East Side,Supposedly this is a Í¢‘„‘ñFrench new wave\u201d restaurant and while the menu isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt especially French the design has a Godardian sense of humor.Lilia,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Missy RobbinsÍ¢‘„‘Žs first restaurant as an owner and the chef specializes in exceptional pasta and grilled Italian seafood.TutÍ¢‘„‘Žs Hub Royal Cuisine,Queens,Astoria,A few blocks south of the Little Egypt strip in Astoria Queens TutÍ¢‘„‘Žs Hub stands three stories crowned by the sun disk of Aten and guarded by a statue of the warrior goddess Sekhmet. The surroundings are lofty but few dishes rise above $10 orders are placed at the cash register and the best dishes have roots in the streets.Angkor Cambodian Bistro,New York,Upper East Side,At Angkor the chef Minh Truong's dishes are gently spiced many harking back to the Thai restaurant he ran in Chelsea for two decades; the best draw from his motherÍ¢‘„‘Žs Cambodian recipes.Insa,Brooklyn,Gowanus,Officially a Korean barbecue restaurant Insa sets itself apart through the modern chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs sensibility displayed in the kitchen.MimiÍ¢‘„‘Žs Hummus,New York,East Village,The best hummus in town may be found at Mimi KitaniÍ¢‘„‘Žs namesake restaurant in Ditmas Park Brooklyn which now has an outpost in the East Village.High Street on Hudson,,West Village,Serious and creative all day long High Street on Hudson understands that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark.Yaso Tangbao,Brooklyn,Downtown Brooklyn,Nearly everything on the menu at this informal restaurant summons up the streets of Shanghai from the giant shaggy pork-belly meatballs called lion's heads majestic and mystifyingly airy to volcanic soup dumplings from a chef who made his name at the first Joe's Shanghai in Flushing Queens.Bouley,New York,TriBeCa,The baronial dining room and the lushness of David BouleyÍ¢‘„‘Žs cooking make this a restaurant for sensualists and romantics.Leche y Miel Restaurant,Bronx,Kingsbridge,Leche y Miel occupies a former pizzeria facing the elevated tracks near the end of the No. 1 train line. Rideiby PeÍ—‘±a the chef and his wife Altagracia PeÍ—‘±a both have roots in the Dominican Republic as do the finest dishes here.

But if the quaint wholesome scene is expected the 30-odd variations of oatmeal are not including bowls Í¢‘„‘î sized in Baby Bear Mama Bear and Papa Bear of course Í¢‘„‘î topped with the likes of bacon truffle oil coconut milk sriracha and GruyÍ—‘Îre.Kichin,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,At Kichin a mostly Korean mostly takeout shop under the Marcy Avenue L train stop the young chef Bryan Moon cooks alongside friends he met while working at a Japanese noodle shop. Occasionally he borrows from that culinary tradition while also championing the dishes of his childhood and inventing a few of his own including a rice ball prickly with bacon shards hiding a soft-boiled quail egg at its center.Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery,Brooklyn,Red Hook,A pizzeria in the Brooklyn-Neapolitan tradition exemplified by RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs and FrannyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Pizza Moto makes excellent use of a restored oven.East Coast PokÍ—‘©,,West Village,Brooklyn-born Alfred DiMartini a former line cook at Lupa and Bouley makes fine honest poke without too many complications and sometimes if youÍ¢‘„‘Žre lucky Spam musubi.Llama Inn,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Llama InnÍ¢‘„‘Žs careful kitchen is interpreting the cuisine of Peru whose vast catalog of ingredients and wild juxtapositions of influences have not been especially well displayed in New York.PokÍ—‘©works,,Midtown South,The Manhattan location of PokÍ—‘©works specializing in Hawaiian poke is the first in a planned nationwide chain. The menu is divided between house-composed Í¢‘„‘ñsignature works\u201d and a vertiginous list of build-it-yourself options and the kitchen follows the assembly-line model which results in the occasional overdose of salt.Sons of Thunder,New York,Murray Hill,Sons of Thunder serves what may be the best Hawaiian poke in town with beautifully fresh fish cut in hunks large enough to give a sense of plushness on the tongue.Wisefish PokÍ—‘©,,Chelsea,Wisefish PokÍ—‘© presents raw fish Hawaiian-style anointed with various sauces and toppings assembled to order with remarkable good cheer; the owners Drew Crane and Bryan Cowan have got the aloha spirit right.Africa Kine,New York,Harlem,Samba Niang and Kine (pronounced kee-nay) Mar natives of Dakar opened this Senegalese restaurant two decades ago on West 116th Street the strip of Harlem known as Le Petit SÍ—‘©nÍ—‘©gal. Rising rents caused them to move it farther uptown to a small humble space once home to a hair salon. By day women cook crowded fragrant stews primed with fermented dried fish and sea snail; men roast monuments of meat by night.Benoit,New York,Midtown,After a shaky beginning Alain DucasseÍ¢‘„‘Žs Benoit has become the most perfect fake bistro in New York.Achilles Heel,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,Long abandoned this waterfront bar has been revived and its mission expanded to included a short highly changeable menu of wine-bar food and slightly more.Pravue Cafe and Albanian Grill,Queens,Ridgewood,Outside Pravue Cafe hovers a two-headed black eagle on a red shingle a descendant of the coat of arms borne into battle by Albanian noblemen in the Middle Ages. Sead Duraku an ethnic Albanian whose family came to the United States after YugoslaviaÍ¢‘„‘Žs dissolution shares duties in the kitchen with his brother Rizo alternating between dishes that look to the West (with at times questionable results) and those that stay true to home made from recipes passed down through generations.La Chine,New York,Midtown East,Chinese cooking with generally excellent ingredients in preparations that climb the slopes of creativity.Taste of Samarkand,Queens,Middle Village,DonÍ¢‘„‘Žt be dissuaded by this Uzbek restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs unassuming exterior. Inside is an arbor with dangling grapes and leaves peeking through a trellis on the ceiling. The menu offers few details beyond each dishÍ¢‘„‘Žs name and some items are available only in certain seasons -- but there is plenty to please including improbably airy samsa (meat pastries) soups exhaling dill and kebabs that are hot gulps of salt and smoke.Per Se,New York,Upper West Side,Thomas KellerÍ¢‘„‘Žs grand hermetic restaurant offers a protracted march of dishes including several classics that are sometimes exquisite.Manila Social Club,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Born in Manila and raised in Indiana BjÍ—‘_rn DelaCruz learned to cook from PBS and Í¢‘„‘ñintense personal study.\u201d Manila Social Club which he runs with his elder sister and his younger brother harks back to their grandmotherÍ¢‘„‘Žs home in Davao Oriental the Philippines with orchids arcing from the windowsills and nostalgia likewise suffuses the best dishes. At times the food travels too far from its origins but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs interesting to follow Mr. DelaCruzÍ¢‘„‘Žs restless imagination.SadelleÍ¢‘„‘Žs,New York,SoHo,A superb bakery is at the core of a sprawling restaurant that serves smoked fish and other Jewish coffee shop food by day and refined Eastern European plates by night.Wassail,New York,Lower East Side,The all-vegetable menu and the staggering variety of ciders make it clear that WassailÍ¢‘„‘Žs owners are obsessed in the best possible way.Kopitiam,New York,Lower East Side,This tiny counter spot with four stools is a loving homage to the Malaysian kopitiam or coffee shop. Kyo Pang the chef grew up in Penang and hopes to keep alive the Baba-Nyonya art of snacks passed down by descendants of Chinese settlers along the Straits of Malacca. LÍ¢‘„‘ŽAmico,New York,Chelsea,Laurent Tourondel works up casual Italian food including pizza that is not greatly innovative but that occasionally glints with originality.Sessanta,New York,SoHo,A polished and urbane setting more negroni than chianti where the kitchen draws on the cooking of southern Italy.Amaranto,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Fermin Teco the chef at this outwardly placid modest family-run Mexican restaurant in a former corner bodega has ambitions submerging a tamale in crab broth and dusting tostadas with fennel salt and dehydrated olives. He has a gentle way with ingredients that allows flavors to emerge decorously rather than shove themselves forward; his father Fermin Teco Sr. oversees the floor with debonair deadpan.Vaucluse,New York,Upper East Side,A reassuringly handsome restaurant whose interpretations of battle-tested French warhorses can be superb quietly competent or oddly off kilter.By Chloe,New York,Greenwich Village,Everything at By Chloe a quick-serve vegan restaurant is designed to be adorable from the puns on the menu (Í¢‘„‘ñKale us maybe!\u201d) to the pert little spot illustrations (a fallen ice cream cone pouting and doomed). Still there is something subversive beneath the cuteness: by casting veganism as effervescent pixie lifestyle rather than as moral crusade By Chloe may be stealthily recruiting more followers to the cause.Tempura Matsui,New York,Murray Hill,A serene Japanese cloister serving no-choice kaiseki-style menus that climax with a volley of vegetable and seafood tempura.Tito KingÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen at JimmyÍ¢‘„‘Žs No. 43,New York,East Village,King Phojanakong the titular Tito (Uncle) King has long drawn from the culinary traditions of his Filipino mother and Thai father at the 12-year-old Kuma Inn on the Lower East Side. At Tito KingÍ¢‘„‘Žs a restaurant-in-residence at the subterranean East Village bar JimmyÍ¢‘„‘Žs No. 43 his brief menu includes chicken wings braised in adobo; pork belly in tacos with a sluice of birdÍ¢‘„‘Žs eye chiles palm sugar and lime for salsa; a grass-fed burger with a trickle of Maggi sauce; and a take on disco fries with ground pork Kewpie mayonnaise and dancing bonito flakes doing the Hustle. The rest of the menu seems slightly perfunctory but this is food meant to encourage drinking a fine-enough mission.Grandchamps,Brooklyn,Bedford Stuyvesant,The chef Shawn Brockman has been trusted with his mother-in-lawÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipes which may explain the generous maternal quality of his dishes.Jams,New York,Midtown,The original Jams was one of the most influential restaurants of the 1980s. The chef Jonathan Waxman brought New Yorkers a report from the front lines of the California cuisine revolution. You canÍ¢‘„‘Žt blame Mr. Waxman for dreaming heÍ¢‘„‘Žd resurrect it one day. But if you go to the version that returned from the grave recently you also canÍ¢‘„‘Žt help wishing it had stayed there. This zombie Jams inside the 1 Hotel Central Park trudges ahead steadily but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre.Chomp Chomp,NY,West Village,Singaporean food courts better known as hawker centers are lined with stalls whose proprietors make a small number of dishes or just a single one over and over. The appeal of Chomp Chomp which the chef and owner Simpson Wong named after one of the countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs most magnetic hawker centers is that you can eat your way from stall to stall without leaving your seat.SchallerÍ¢‘„‘Žs Stube,,Upper East Side,The sausages at this annex to Schaller &amp; Weber a venerable butcher shop on the Upper East Side make a mockery of the buns meant to contain them.O Ya,New York,Kips Bay,Tim Cushman the creative and prolific chef of O Ya in Boston and this spinoff in Manhattan does not break the rules of Japanese cuisine. He slices them into tiny pieces fries them to a crisp and heaps them over raw fish. Bite by bite he gets away with it. But over the entire course of the two prolonged tastings that are the only options at the New York branch one for $185 and the other for $245 the rules eventually catch up with him.Timna,,East Village,Timna refers to both an ancient Yemeni city on the frankincense route and a valley in southern Israel once home it is believed to King SolomonÍ¢‘„‘Žs mines. The chef Nir Mesika grew up in Israel and can trace his ancestry back to Egypt and Morocco. His cooking is at its strongest when he draws from memory as with kubaneh a Yemenite-Jewish bread somewhere between brioche and challah or a simple dish of vegetables and farro laced with raw tahini and date molasses summoning a pang for peanut butter and jelly. The more baroque dishes lack focus. The beautiful dining room has the tone of an underlit grotto with scraped-down brick and overgrown herbs spilling out of wooden boxes. Spiky little air plants mark each table a reminder Mr. Mesika said of life in the desert.Asian Spicy Curry,New York,Chinatown,In Chinatown near the quieter southern end of Mulberry Street stands Mama Eatery a restaurant with Chinese characters on the window and Western food on the menu (French toast for breakfast linguine pomodoro for lunch). Come dark the dining room dims and butcher paper is neatly clipped over the metal tabletops. The quick set change signals the arrival of a new chef in the kitchen Yip Khuan Thye a native of Kuala Lumpur Malaysia bearing curry leaves and candlenuts. The curries on the nocturnal menu are priced at $6 or $7 each a small world. Some are curry soups with cloudy rust-red broths that suggest cream of velvet and a choice of noodles in three widths others hefty plates of chicken or beef paired with jasmine rice or crescents of flaking roti. Ms. Yip is no youngster trying to break into the restaurant business; sheÍ¢‘„‘Žs a home cook who for years contented herself with feeding friends. The owner of Mama Eatery David Ma and his daughter Michelle an architect hope to win her a wider audience here.Bruno Pizza,New York,East Village,BrunoÍ¢‘„‘Žs chefs Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino mill the flour for their pizza dough in the basement from whole New York State wheat berries and ferment it slowly with a sourdough starter. Few if any local pizzerias go to these lengths and you wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt taste a crust like BrunoÍ¢‘„‘Žs anywhere else. What the raised perimeter lacks in crunch it makes up for in earthy whole-grain flavor. When it comes to toppings the chefs donÍ¢‘„‘Žt play it safe either. Their nearest approach to a classic pie is their margherita with a sauce that incorporates sweet juicy garlic and some fermented tomatoes. The appetizers are more perplexing. As a lot they look more interesting than they are.Momofuku Ko,New York,East Village,David ChangÍ¢‘„‘Žs original Momofuku Ko was a daring experiment that asked: If you aspired to serve food as original and refined as anything in an expensive uptown restaurant but wanted to keep prices down exactly how many amenities could you strip out? The answer turned out to be Í¢‘„‘ñNot quite that many Dave\u201d but the question was the right one at the right time. With KoÍ¢‘„‘Žs move to a larger space a few blocks south that experiment officially ended. The new Ko has amenities galore and a price to match. There is a high degree of finesse in executive chef Sean GrayÍ¢‘„‘Žs $175 tasting menus much more comfort for cooks and diners alike and wine in uncannily delicate glasses from some of the worldÍ¢‘„‘Žs most revered grape stompers. The restaurant is not an experiment but rather a statement of what fancy dining has become in large part due to the influence of the original. Safari,,Harlem,Safari which may be the only Somali restaurant in New York City stands on a stretch of 116th Street known as Le Petit SÍ—‘©nÍ—‘©gal for the thousands of West African immigrants who make their home in the neighborhood. Somalia is on the opposite coast and the food here bears little resemblance to the viscous West African stews found elsewhere on the strip. There are fine heaps of meat underscored by African birdseye chiles; influences from across the gulf and the Arabian Sea; and turmeric-tinged rice nestled companionably beside pasta in a quasi-Alfredo sauce of coconut and cowÍ¢‘„‘Žs milks imbued with oregano rosemary and basil Í¢‘„‘î a legacy of SomaliaÍ¢‘„‘Žs half-century of Italian occupation. Traditionally a banana comes with every Somali meal. But after some confused diners refused the fruit early on the owner Muymuuna Birjeeb who goes by Mona considered handing them out only to fellow Somalis who would understand. If youÍ¢‘„‘Žre offered one be grateful.Wildair,,Lower East Side,The chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened this wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant Contra. In a subtle and charming way the kid upstages his big brother. Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as Manfreds &amp; Vin in Copenhagen and Le Dauphin in Paris places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up and unwind and make plans. The food at Wildair isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt necessarily better but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs often more inventive. You wouldnÍ¢‘„‘Žt guess that from scanning the menu reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar likable food but instead of tying them down this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude.Goa Taco,New York,Lower East Side,Goa Taco serves in theory tacos. They are half-moon in shape but in lieu of a thin pliant tortilla fillings Í¢‘„‘î Chinese five-spice duck confit say or Oaxacan-style achiote lamb with Greek tzatziki Í¢‘„‘î are trapped inside paratha a many-layered Indian flatbread built like a chapbook of dough each leaf inscribed with ghee. Some might call these sandwiches. But grant Goa Taco a little poetic license: its tacos by any other name would be as delicious. Duvaldi Marneweck the chef and owner grew up in Pretoria South Africa and has cooked in England and Australia. He hasnÍ¢‘„‘Žt made it to Goa; the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name comes from Australian slang (Í¢‘„‘ñI could really go a beer mate\u201d). But it also carries a whiff of longing for a distant as yet unseen shore.Houseman,New York,Hudson Square,HousemanÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is laid out like a newspaperÍ¢‘„‘Žs front page. The date runs at the top to the left of the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name. A weather report is on the right. In the middle is a cryptic drawing of what might be a pumpkin with dangerous ideas. All around him are boxes occupied by dishes that change daily. You donÍ¢‘„‘Žt taste HousemanÍ¢‘„‘Žs food in politely appreciative nibbles. You throw yourself at it until thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality but when you find a restaurant that has it you come back. Houseman has it. Gabriel Kreuther,,Midtown,When the chef Gabriel Kreuther left the Modern in 2013 he seems to have packed up virtually everything except PicassoÍ¢‘„‘Žs goat in the sculpture garden. He named the place he opened on 42nd Street after himself but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile. He took along the ModernÍ¢‘„‘Žs pastry chef Marc Aumont a virtuoso of desserts and breads. He replicated its two-in-one structure too. In the bar where gooseneck streetlamps crane out over low tables he has an approachable menu some of it Alsatian. Things get far more elaborate once you enter the dining room behind a ring of rough timber columns. And of course Mr. Kreuther brought his recipes. His cooking makes an irresistible case for the power of classical European techniques all the blade-flicking and stock-skimming tricks that Mr. Kreuther swings around so easily.LucyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Vietnamese Kitchen,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Pho chay the vegetarian version of pho bo Vietnamese beef-broth noodle soup is often mild and self-effacing perhaps in keeping with its Buddhist origins. At LucyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Vietnamese Kitchen however it has a bold near-funk from long-simmering shiitake mushrooms charred shallots ginger and a suffusion of spices. The broth as crystalline as consommÍ—‘© is lovely in its pristine state but even better besmirched by brisket that has been smoked for 14 hours and lands in the bowl with dark fringes and the juices running. The young chef Phuoc Huynh known as Johnny grew up Í¢‘„‘î and still lives Í¢‘„‘î in an apartment a block away with his grandmother (Lucy of course) who raised him.Casa Mono,New York,Gramercy Park,Founded by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich in 2003 Casa Mono was among the earliest and most influential restaurants to twist the Spanish tapas idiom into what New Yorkers learned to call small-plates dining. Andy Nusser the executive chef and an owner kept the tapas fairly uncomplicated in the early days. But Anthony Sasso chef de cuisine under Mr. Nusser has led the kitchen into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach. In a miracle of space management this tiny restaurant keeps what has to be the deepest most pleasure-packed trove of Spanish wine in the city.Babu Ji,New York,East Village,Babu Ji stands half a mile from the East VillageÍ¢‘„‘Žs declining Curry Row where Indian restaurants once huddled shoulder to shoulder epauletted in twinkle lights and nearly indistinguishable. The distance is calculated: Babu JiÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is succinct rather than sprawling the dining room a sleek diagram of black floors white walls and gray tables with pops of color from Bollywood films flickering by the bar. And the food is remarkably fresh and light. Jessi Singh the chef grew up working the family farm first in a village in northern India and later in a series of Australian outback towns. At times his approach to Indian cuisine is overly subtle but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to resist the elegantly feral plates overgrown with leaves flowers and berries.Superiority Burger,,East Village,New ideas fly through Superiority BurgerÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen so quickly you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates the place above what it appears to be at first glance a Shake Shack for vegetarians. Bright original sandwiches and sides arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later. Some things you can be sure of finding every time like the meatless sloppy Joe with tofu in a riotously spicy tomato sauce and the veggie wrap that for once does not taste like pulverized drywall moistened with MorrisseyÍ¢‘„‘Žs tears. Some beef eaters may find the meatless burger almost too convincing; it takes you almost all the way then stops. Dessert which changes nightly of course is a two-scoop duet of sorbet and ice cream both exceptional; there is probably not a more meticulously put together $4 dessert in the city.The Food Sermon,Brooklyn,Crown Heights,A theology-school dropout who found salvation in the kitchen Rawlston Williams the chef at the Food Sermon grew up in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Caribbean food is a mainstay of Crown Heights; what elevates the dishes here is the extraordinary brightness of the flavors as if a veil has dropped. Mr. Williams has a particular gift for meat achieving tenderness without surrendering flavor. (This despite having been raised as a Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian.) He never intended the Food Sermon to be a restaurant just a catering kitchen with a few dishes for standing-room-only customers. Then the neighbors came crowding in. For those who live farther way his patient thoughtful cooking is worth a pilgrimage.The Clocktower,New York,Midtown South,The Clocktower plays a familiar game the private club that has accidentally let you in. Above the wainscoting of book-matched burl and below the wedding-cake crown moldings hang framed photographs in black and white one above another gallery style. They show celebrities from the 1950s Í¢‘„‘ƒ60s and Í¢‘„‘ƒ70s dozens and dozens of them. When you ask about one a server brings you an explanatory booklet printed on heavy paper stock. Luckily the Clocktower only looks clubby. In spirit itÍ¢‘„‘Žs accessible. The cooking of Jason Atherton an English chef who worked under Gordon Ramsay has the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy not to reflect his own glory. There are nods to English tradition here and there but most of the food has the kind of celebratory elegance that traditional hotel dining rooms promise to deliver and rarely do.Oiji,New York,East Village,OijiÍ¢‘„‘Žs two chefs Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku grew up in Korea and met in culinary school in the United States. Years after graduation they leased a room with a lineage the former site of Dok Suni the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. The new place Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok SuniÍ¢‘„‘Žs demise. In some ways it continues its predecessorÍ¢‘„‘Žs mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It has something in common too with the chef Hooni KimÍ¢‘„‘Žs places Danji and Hanjan; like them it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on KoreaÍ¢‘„‘Žs more intense flavors while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance.Chevalier,New York,Midtown,Chevalier calls itself a Í¢‘„‘ñbrasserie de luxe.\u201d The first person who can explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a free choucroute garnie for 12. It looks walks and talks like a formal restaurant set up to showcase a chef Í¢‘„‘î in this case Shea Gallante. There is a lot to enjoy on his menu; some of the meats (a charcuterie plate; long slices of duck; a melting Berkshire pork loin) are so extraordinary that you can forget about the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs identity crisis. The designer Stephen Sills gave the windowless dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; itÍ¢‘„‘Žs pretty but it also looks like a movie directorÍ¢‘„‘Žs idea of a restaurant for rich people. But Chevalier is probably not meant for anybody whoÍ¢‘„‘Žs in the habit of reading over the check before signing it.Chicks To Go,Queens,The Rockaways,At this Peruvian pollerÍ—‘_a (rotisserie-chicken shop) a block from the beach chicken is saturated for half a day with cumin oregano garlic soy and smoky aji panca pepper then turned over flame until the skin blisters and shimmers and the juices run mad within. Some of the meat is destined for aji gallina a creamy stew that is all the more luxurious when it spills out of an otherwise ordinary-looking empanada; or for chaufa from the Chinese chao fan (fried rice) even better made with quinoa grown in Peru. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs owners Leyla and Ximena Yrala are sisters from Lima. They keep a stash of the Peruvian soda Inca Kola behind the counter in cans of gold and Lake Titicaca blue.Untitled,New York,Meatpacking District,If you can get past the name a graduate-school groaner there is nothing pretentious about Untitled. Although the restaurant is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art it is resolutely uninterested in arty food. Michael Anthony the chef; Suzanne Cupps the chef de cuisine; and Miro Uskokovic the pastry chef use market produce flamboyantly as though they were trying to get the purse-lipped farm-to-table puritans who solemnly hand you a single baby zucchini to crack a smile.El Rey Coffee Bar and Luncheonette,,Lower East Side,The chef is Gerardo Gonzalez a native of San Diego. He has worked out a point of view in the kitchen that is distinctly his own a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines. The service is California chill. Ordering is uncomplicated. El Rey has few of the comforts of a larger more elaborate restaurant but none of the discomforts either.Langos Truck,New York,Astoria,If you are Hungarian this is the taste of summer: langos (pronounced LAHN-gauche) a rough disc of fried flatbread cracker-crisp along the circumference and chewier toward the center where it approaches gooeyness. In its simplest form with just a swab of crushed garlic and salt sour cream and Medusa curls of Edam cheese itÍ¢‘„‘Žs startlingly light resting in the hand as daintily as a halo. At the Langos Truck Zsolt Prepuk a native of Budapest also serves sandwiches of Mangalitsa pork sausages in honor of the woolly Hungarian pigs bred to feed Hapsburg emperors whose lushly marbled meat is likened to Kobe beef. The price is four times the average hot dogÍ¢‘„‘Žs; it should be.KikiÍ¢‘„‘Žs,New York,Chinatown,On the easternmost block of Division Street in Chinatown olive-green French doors are flung open on the sidewalk and small lemon trees reach up from Grecian-style urns. KikiÍ¢‘„‘Žs Greek Tavern the awning announces Í¢‘„‘î in Chinese characters a nod to the neighborhood. The menu is littered with words like Í¢‘„‘ñclassic\u201d Í¢‘„‘ñuncomplicated\u201d and Í¢‘„‘ñchildhood\u201d all to the good. Bread arrives slashed with char fries spiky with oregano shrimp soused on ouzo and cream. The food is rich but somehow feels good for you. KikiÍ¢‘„‘Žs is the kind of place where fresh carafes of water are plonked on the table even after the bill has been settled and youÍ¢‘„‘Žre allowed Í¢‘„‘î invited Í¢‘„‘î to idle.Lupulo,New York,Chelsea,George MendesÍ¢‘„‘Žs basic idea for Lupulo was straightforward enough. The place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The American equivalent is probably a brewpub which Lupulo resembles with its hard low wooden chairs and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance. Much of the menu gets right into the beery spirit with food thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs left a little rough around the edges. Other times the kitchen veers off message sending out artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if theyÍ¢‘„‘Žd be more at home at Mr. MendesÍ¢‘„‘Žs other more formal restaurant Aldea. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a little confusing but luckily the forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. Also disorienting at least at first is the beer selection. Why open a cervejaria and turn over almost all the taps to American craft breweries? But Lupulo tracks down some of the most innovative and engaging beers in the country. Again flavor saves the day.Rebelle,New York,Nolita,In French the name means rebel. The implied assault on tradition may be fairly tame stuff but you bump into it all over the restaurant. The unforced modern intermittently French food is inspired by one particular rebellion. The chef Daniel Eddy comes to Rebelle straight from the Paris restaurant Spring a member of the loosely bound bistronomy movement. Despite its bistronomic pedigree Rebelle wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt strike most New Yorkers as a huge departure. It should however strike them as a very good place to eat seasonal food that flirts with French ideas in novel ways. Another rebellion turns up in the wine list. For this modern French restaurant with an American chef all the wines come from France and the United States and many are made in the contemporary hands-off style. If youÍ¢‘„‘Žve written off all domestic wines as big galumphing overpriced beasts drink a few of the lithe and inexpensive creatures Rebelle has picked up in the Finger Lakes the Pacific Northwest and the Central California Coast. There are expensive blockbusters here but there are also so many bottles just above and below $50 that itÍ¢‘„‘Žs easy to lose count. As at RebelleÍ¢‘„‘Žs sister next door Pearl &amp; Ash the prices make experimentation painless. PETE WELLSThe Handpulled Noodle,New York,Harlem,The hand-pulled noodles at this counter-seating-only restaurant come from Xinjiang in ChinaÍ¢‘„‘Žs far northwest. They are denser and rougher than the more widely known Lanzhou-style hand-pulled noodles found in Chinatown and fantastically chewy. Andrew Ding the owner was born in Urumqi and raised in Sydney Australia; both parts of the world share a love of lamb and that meat is what gives contour and depth to the finest dishes here. The space has an unpretentious downtown air with a raw-concrete floor vintage chicken feeders turned lampshades and the legend Í¢‘„‘ñWe Pull Your Noodle\u201d graffitied over exposed brick. A note at the bottom of the menu admonishes: Í¢‘„‘ñNoodles are best eaten immediately!\u201d Heed it.The Happiest Hour,New York,Greenwich Village,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs all about the burger at this vaguely tropical spot in Greenwich Village. There are several on the menu but the $12 Happiest Burger a blatant homage to the California-born In-N-Out burger is the showstopper. Double-pattied correctly seasoned dripping with American cheese canyon-deep with flavor from onion confit onions and a sauce suffused with mustard the burger is flat-out terrific. (The rest of the food menu? Not so much.) And it goes well with the cocktails which are better than youÍ¢‘„‘Žd expect from an establishment that might have hired Jimmy Buffett as its interior decorator. (The Link Ray tastes like what might happen if a mojito and a Bloody Mary had a baby and named her Celery.) There is a separate bar downstairs called Slowly Shirley which feels like a Hollywood canteen where Bogart and Bacall could have met for a clandestine date in 1944. There the burger finds its ideal companion: the cold smooth FAF martini. Noreetuh,,East Village,With prime ingredients carefully organized plates and nonviolent prices Noreetuh tries to tidy up Hawaiian dishes like garlic shrimp and tuna poke for their introduction to New York. The overachieving wine list is very reasonably priced; just by sticking to your budget you can drink at a higher level than usual.The Eddy,New York,East Village,Small and modest-looking restaurant the Eddy sits on East Sixth StreetÍ¢‘„‘Žs disappearing row of interchangeable curry spots. The chef is Brendan McHale and his cooking can range from exceptional to somewhat forgettable. Everybody is exceptionally pleasant the acoustics are unusually friendly and the drinking is so good that the place could function as a cocktail lounge or wine bar. The Eddy is one of those restaurants that gets so many little details right that your main course can be a little shaky and you can still walk out happy.Blanca,Brooklyn,Bushwick,When Blanca opened in 2012 a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor but about cooking for maximum pleasure it is unswervingly serious. Carlo Mirarchi the chef and owner of Blanca and its sprawling mothership RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs is a rigorous miniaturist combining a few ingredients at a time into two or three-bite compositions that are utterly complete even if they leave you wanting more. Over the years he has steadily refined his marathon tastings and nearly everything served is remarkable in one way or another.I Love Paraguay,Queens,Sunnyside,At this rare outpost of Paraguayan cooking in New York City the best dishes are the most traditional like mbeju a meld of cassava starch milk eggs and Muenster that suggests a further step in the evolution of a quesadilla and chipa guazu a savory cake sweetened with whole corn kernels and teetering on soufflÍ—‘©. Nancy Ojeda a native of AsunciÍ—‘_n the Paraguayan capital runs the informal restaurant with her husband Carlos and her son Fabricio. Tables are surrounded by images of Paraguayan waterfalls and unpaved roads along with three TV screens most likely tuned to soccer. I Love Paraguay started out as a bakery and Ms. OjedaÍ¢‘„‘Žs desserts assembled in a case at the back are still the main attraction particularly mousse maracuja voluptuous with passionfruit condensed milk and media crema with a maraschino cherry on top like a little heart.Mission Chinese Food,New York,Lower East Side,Idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the BloominÍ¢‘„‘Ž Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse. In the first New York location most of the idiosyncrasies looped around Sichuan cuisine. Many of the old dishes marked as much by a freethinking approach as by the burn and tingle of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns are still on the menu. But this kind of scorched-tongue cooking has become a minor motif. Fewer than a third of the items are marked by red flames blazing from what looks like a pair of cheeks and not the ones you kiss your grandmother on. The rest is not just less fire-spewing but more varied than before drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond China.Okonomi,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Japanese breakfast is the specialty here served until afternoon as a set menu that includes rice miso soup pickled vegetables a choice of fish and two amuse-bouche-size sides. For an additional $2 you can add the small wonder of an onsen egg modeled after the Japanese tradition of cooking eggs in the sulfurous waters of hot springs which keep them at constant low heat until they emerge with the classic ratio of loose yolk and stable white inverted. Tucked inside a low clapboard house on a tree-shaded street the quiet dining room feels almost atemporal. Chopsticks rest on oyster half-shells and worn stones. Jazz wanders as if out of a Haruki Murakami novel. You leave not quite full and happy.Punda Tibetan,Queens,Sunnyside,Tenzing TseringÍ¢‘„‘Žs rÍ—‘©sumÍ—‘© could be a case study in culinary diaspora. He grew up as a Tibetan refugee in northeast India He cooked at Tibetan restaurants in Moscow and Siberia at KathmanduÍ¢‘„‘Žs only vegetarian hotel and at the high-end Indian restaurant Tulsi in Manhattan and was the personal chef to the president of the Russian (and predominantly Tibetan Buddhist) republic of Kalmykia. Happily his food is now available to the common people at his two restaurants in Queens: GangJong Kitchen a cramped Woodside storefront equipped with two induction burners and no oven and Punda Tibetan which has four times the space a backyard and a proper kitchen for more ambitious cooking. The menu with just three dishes over $10 is nomadic in spirit but the best dishes Í¢‘„‘î momos (dumplings) soups of remarkable clarity beef sautÍ—‘©s of alternating brightness and heat Í¢‘„‘î are the ones identified as Tibetan.Aquavit,New York,Midtown East,Aquavit has been open since 1987 in which time it made the reputation of one Marcus Samuelsson and navigated a move from a light-drenched atrium with a defining waterfall to a more prosaic space in a pink-granite tower in the East 50s. It has struggled recently to find the right tone in its dining room which still isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt as comfortable as it could be. Its kitchen is soaring though. Emma Bengtsson the chef cooks modern Scandinavian cuisine without aping the fashionable Nordic tropes. Her cooking is as complex as it is finely tuned.CrÍ—‘_pes Canaveral,New York,East Village,At this takeout stand the size of a carnival ticket booth Jean-Christophe Henry makes Breton crepes from a family recipe that dates back to the late 19th century. Unlike in eastern Brittany where savory crepes called galettes are thick and made with all-buckwheat flour his are thin and cut with a little wheat in the style of western Brittany where he grew up. They are still classically sooty in appearance with pockets of shadow like the seas of the moon but remarkably light tasting of earth and air at once. Mr. Henry uses two griddles Í¢‘„‘î one for pouring the batter the other for filling it Í¢‘„‘î to ensure the smoothest circles possible and shifts crepes between them without a flip. He encourages customers to eat inside the adjacent William Barnacle Tavern to which CrÍ—‘_pes Canaveral is attached a low-key Celtic-leaning bar that was once the taproom of a Prohibition-era speakeasy and still looks it.Javelina,New York,Gramercy Park,Javelina bills itself as New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs Í¢‘„‘ñfirst authentic Tex-Mex restaurant.\u201d If this is authentic itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a wonder that anybody in Texas ever goes out to eat. You may get what you ordered or you may get what somebody else ordered. The chile con queso tends to be cold but at least the water is warm. The flour tortillas are the best thing about the restaurant. They are very good.Kottu House,New York,Lower East Side,Kottu House doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt abide by the usual tropes of New York CityÍ¢‘„‘Žs Sri Lankan restaurants many of which are clustered on Staten Island where they cater primarily to a population of some 5000 Sri Lankans. A devilÍ¢‘„‘Žs face with goggle eyes and swollen tongue is projected in random glow-stick colors above the bar to the low pulse of trance music. On the wall demure black-and-white ancestral portraits are mixed with snaps of friends clowning for the camera. Chelaka Gunamuni a young man in stubbly beard and tattoos (one a birthday gift from his wife) tends to the front of the house while his mother Sandya Í¢‘„‘ñMadu\u201d De Silva cooks a short menu focused on kottu a Sri Lankan street food that tosses together tatters of roti scrambled eggs and long-simmering curry.Fung Tu,New York,Lower East Side,In the headwaters of Orchard Street just off East BroadwayÍ¢‘„‘Žs warren of Fujianese places the chef Jonathan Wu plunders Chinese traditions to weave a modern cuisine of his own imagining. A two-year veteran of Per Se his cooking relies heavily on nuance and as the restaurant has matured the accents have been filled in. There is plenty of power in the Sichuan pork sauce in his china-quiles a brunch dish that stays in its pajamas until dinner rolls around. The template is ma po tofu but the bean curd has been replaced by an egg custard so smooth and silky it almost parts itself when your spoon gets close. Jason Wagner Fung TuÍ¢‘„‘Žs drinks overlord and general manager has clever ideas about what to pour with Mr. WuÍ¢‘„‘Žs subtle oblique cooking. He is worth listening to when he suggests a Gran Barquero amontillado that tastes like toasted hazelnuts dipped in caramel for the thin-cut fried pork chops with pickled mustard greens a Chinatown classic here given a tangy syrupy sherry glaze.Raclette,Manhattan,East Village,At this tiny storefront great half-wheels of cheese sit in metal grips under quartz heating lamps. The melting surface is scraped down tableside over a plate of cornichons pickled pearl onions roasted potatoes and thin purplish-red slices of air-dried beef. Raclette is the name of both the cheese and the dish which originated in the Swiss Alps in the 13th century. Dining here with only eight seats and no liquor license Í¢‘„‘î so no fendant the crisp Swiss white wine considered a prerequisite for raclette consumption Í¢‘„‘î is not exactly like lounging in a larchwood chalet after a day on the pistes. Still it is deeply satisfying to watch the cascade of cheese and to dig out the vegetables and meat below as if eating fondue in reverse. LIGAYA MISHANHanYang BunSik,Queens,Flushing,HanYang BunSik started out as a tented stall outside the 24-hour HanYang Mart in Flushing Queens. Now it occupies a proper corner of the market with wooden tables and benches packed efficiently back to back. Dishes fall under the Korean category of bunsik or snacks including blood sausage embedded with sticky rice kabocha porridge and a skewered hot dog with an airy crust of panko like a corn dog from the fairy realm. Many are more substantial than snacks in the Western definition a reminder of how far we lag behind other cultures in this culinary genre. Late at night a sense of nostalgia takes hold as men in suits hunker over glasses of soju beside walls papered with photographs of Korean pines.Mu Ramen,Queens,Long Island City,Of all the restaurants in the city where you are expected to make loud slurping noises while you eat Joshua and Heidy SmooklerÍ¢‘„‘Žs Mu Ramen may be the most civilized. The 22 seats half-fill a space that could easily hold more and if you have to wait for one of them (after an experiment with reservations the place is first come first served) the deep built-in benches by the front door are a pleasant change from say the steps in front of Totto Ramen in HellÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen. Mr. Smookler trained in the meticulous rigor of Per SeÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen and has a Keller-like drive to find a better way. This usually means a harder and more costly way. When his supply of pork for tonkotsu broth suddenly dried up he went to the Midwest and persuaded nearly 40 farmers who raised Berkshire hogs to start a cooperative. Then he arranged for a small slaughterhouse to butcher the four cuts of pork he wanted and ship them to Long Island City where he would cook 120 pounds of bones at a raging boil for 16 hours. If $15 seems a fair price for those ingredients the conviction only grows once you start eating. East Wind Snack Shop,Brooklyn,Windsor Terrace,East Wind Snack Shop is a modern homage to ChinatownÍ¢‘„‘Žs bygone working-class coffee houses cramped dingy storefronts offering unlimited tea and limited food with plastic fans stuttering above strategically hung fly paper and a lot of (happy) yelling between tables. Chris Cheung the chef grew up half in Brooklyn and half on Mott Street where his grandparents lived. He trained in high-end kitchens but insists that heÍ¢‘„‘Žs not trying to elevate the food here. Nevertheless the pot stickers are packed with dry-aged beef from DeBragga; Niman Ranch pork is ground in-house for dumplings; and foie gras pÍ—‘¢tÍ—‘© is sealed inside house-made steamed buns of impeccable pallor.MintonÍ¢‘„‘Žs ,New York,Harlem,When assessing the role that the soul food at MintonÍ¢‘„‘Žs Playhouse played in the birth of bebop in the 1940s it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at MintonÍ¢‘„‘Žs once and this was one reason to pay attention to the revival of MintonÍ¢‘„‘Žs as a jazz supper club. The menu now looks toward Lowcountry cuisine which carries lasting imprints of West African and Caribbean cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina like smooth she-crab soup and shrimp on fat fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme including collards that are cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. The kitchen is a little unpredictable and the success of dinner at MintonÍ¢‘„‘Žs depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune toying with a rhythm tying and untying knots of harmony.Casa Del Chef,Queens,Woodside,Casa Del Chef is not an Ecuadorean restaurant despite the Andean pan flutes on the soundtrack and the heritage of its chef and owner Alfonso Zhicay who grew up on a sugar-cane plantation in Gualaceo. The food Í¢‘„‘î the kind of thoughtful farm-to-table cooking now standard in other parts of the city but still a rarity in this neighborhood Í¢‘„‘î is rooted in the country Mr. Zhicay now calls home. After immigrating to the United States in 1994 he spent more than a decade working with Dan Barber eventually rising to the position of head catering chef at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Mr. BarberÍ¢‘„‘Žs influence is evident not only in Mr. ZhicayÍ¢‘„‘Žs attention to season and provenance but also in the way he lets each ingredient speak for itself gently encouraging rather than imposing and hastening flavors.Santina,New York,Meatpacking District,From the team behind Dirty French and Carbone an Italian ode to eternal sunshine inside a glass-box building under the High Line. Oranges grow on a tree tropical flowers gush from urns above the bar and servers wear jelly-bean colored polo shirts with slim-waisted chinos like Dean Martin reaching for his nine-iron at Pebble Beach. Almost all the food pulses with the bright refreshing flavors we crave in hot weather: jolts of chiles sparks of citrus fistfuls of fresh herbs. Most of it particularly toward the top of the menu is charming and playful in a way thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to fight.Estiatorio Milos,New York,Midtown,Since 1997 Milos has served Greek cuisine particularly whole fish and shellfish kept on ice near the open kitchen to loyal customers who can afford the forbidding prices. It is one of the few places in town specializing in imported species like red mullet gilt-head bream spiny lobsters and carabineiros luxuriously sweet and supple red shrimp. The kitchen does well with other items too including excellent double-cut lamb chops and a signature appetizer of thin sheets of fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki but the prices can read like a long string of typographical errors.Limani,New York,Midtown,LimaniÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is Greek and its strength is formidably expensive seafood which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen. The selection and quality can make a seafood lover dizzy but LimaniÍ¢‘„‘Žs finesse at the grill does not always carry through to the rest of the kitchen. The striking modern dining room with blindingly white marble and an infinity pool in the center will remind some diners of the Aegean; others will see South Beach.SpaHa Soul,New York,East Harlem,Í¢‘„‘ñThis is the most informal dining experience youÍ¢‘„‘Žll ever have\u201d said Artist Thornton the owner and Í¢‘„‘ñchef\u201d (quotation marks his) of this idiosyncratic and lovely little restaurant. Plates may be china or plastic; silverware is rolled in paper napkins secured by rubber bands. The menu exists on a single iPad that is passed around. The food which traverses Louisiana Mexico and India has an improvised feel with dishes made for (and named after) neighbors and friends. SpaHa Soul is not a destination for those seeking culinary bedazzlement; a different kind of nourishment is on offer. Enter the restaurant and you become part of Mr. ThorntonÍ¢‘„‘Žs small bright sphere of influence where dinner is just an excuse for camaraderie. As night unspools strangers lean between tables to introduce themselves as if inspired by their hostÍ¢‘„‘Žs gregariousness.Masha &amp; the Bear,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,According to Vitaly Sherman who runs Masha and the Bear with his wife Maria (known as Masha) Peter the Great mandated that all Russian inns keep a stash of horseradish vodka in their cellars for the rejuvenation of weary travelers. Here the horseradish vodka is infused in-house and stored in pressurized kegs to avoid exposure to air. Anya Vasilenko the chef cleaves to tradition with dishes like ukha a fish soup purportedly beloved by Ivan the Terrible and Herring in a Fur Coat a salad born of the Russian Revolution uniting proletarian herring and peasant potatoes under a mantle of beets in Bolshevik red. Mr. Sherman a native of Belarus who came to the United States in 1989 is an effusive ambassador for the cuisine and culture of his youth.Haldi,,Kips Bay,HaldiÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is a delightful compendium of cultural references to the city of Kolkata in West Bengal India drawing on the culinary traditions of Bengalis the British Raj Marwari migrants from Rajasthan KolkataÍ¢‘„‘Žs Chinatown (the birthplace of Indian Chinese cuisine) and the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs small but once influential community of Baghdadi Jews. Hemant Mathur the chef and co-owner is a rare talent who made his name at some of New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs finest Indian restaurants. He brings to the kitchen quiet fastidiousness while staying true to the homey nature of the dishes. Haldi means turmeric in Hindi thus the sunny yellow chairs under chandeliers of green bottles and copper woklike pans called kadhais inverted and fixed to the ceiling. The dining room isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt fancy but it sets a notably elegant tone for Curry Hill.Little Park,,TriBeCa,Since becoming his own boss Andrew Carmellini has usually cooked in and around the traditions of one country or another. At Little Park he and his chef de cuisine Min Kong are working out their ideas from scratch. This may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh natural and intuitive than whatÍ¢‘„‘Žs on his other menus. Little Park is Mr. CarmelliniÍ¢‘„‘Žs most contemporary restaurant having less in common with Locanda Verde than it does with forward-leaning places like Estela or Cosme. In the modern fashion most dishes are of roughly the same size and complexity. There are no second-class ingredients and almost no side dishes. The vegetables and they are numerous are as intriguing as the animals. Eleven Madison Park,New York,Midtown South,Eleven Madison Park adopted a tasting menu on the theme of New York meals have been marred by goofy tableside history lessons. And the chef Daniel Humm practices a locavorism that is strictly entry-level stuff. What Eleven Madison feeds your intellect can have the value of junk food but what it feeds your mouth stomach and spirit is something else. Both the kitchen and the dining room staff try as hard as any to bring delight to the table with every course. They succeed so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist.Bowery Meat Company,New York,East Village,The chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald the pair behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco have brought forth a Í¢‘„‘ñmeat company\u201d whose website says it is Í¢‘„‘ñnot a traditional steakhouse but a balanced meat-centric menu.\u201d Bowery Meat Company is not in fact a menu. But it does have a menu and on it you will find seven cuts of beef plus a burger potatoes cooked four ways and a spinach side dish. But then it leaves steakhouse menus behind with Chinese barbecue-style pork belly or the duck lasagna for two. And there is more. Much more. You can eat at Bowery Meat Company multiple times and barely put a dent in the menu though it will leave its mark on you. Whether he is cooking beef or broiling oysters Mr. Capon knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them.House of Inasal,Queens,Woodside,This Filipino restaurant in a stretch of Queens known as Little Manila feels spacious and sleepy operating at the pace of a desultory ceiling fan. The menu is congenial offering unlimited rice all-day breakfast and street specialties like grilled pork intestines and kwek-kwek (deep-fried quail eggs). Ricardo Aguirre the chef and a native of the Philippines started cooking at his fatherÍ¢‘„‘Žs two turo-turo (cafeteria-style) restaurants in Jersey City attended the Culinary Institute of America and worked the line at Craftbar and Nobu. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a career trajectory that could easily have led him to selling haute free-range kwek-kwek from a Smorgasburg stall. Instead heÍ¢‘„‘Žs delivering straightforward comfort food Í¢‘„‘î unmodernized unexalted Í¢‘„‘î with no concessions to Western palates.La Morada,Bronx,North New York,La MoradaÍ¢‘„‘Žs married owners Natalia Mendez and Antonio Saavedra were once farmers in Oaxaca which is one of the poorest states in Mexico but whose cuisine is among the countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs richest. While much of the menu is taken up by tacos and quesadillas a few dishes offer a glimpse of the Í¢‘„‘ñinfinite gastronomy\u201d that is Oaxacan cooking. Ms. MendezÍ¢‘„‘Žs food tastes as if it was made by someone who has looked you in the eye which she does checking on diners throughout the meal busing emptied tortilla baskets and ferrying bulging clay cups of cinnamon tea. There are ideas in the air along with the scent of corn from tortillas growing pliant on the comal: Ms. MendezÍ¢‘„‘Žs son Marco the host waiter and poet in residence has pinned up a Í¢‘„‘ñMesoamÍ—‘©rica Resiste\u201d poster and stocked a lending library in the back with Plutarch Orwell and Plath. Via Carota,New York,West Village,Jody Williams who shares responsibility for Via CarotaÍ¢‘„‘Žs Italian menu with Rita Sodi has filled Via Carota with antique nail barrels china hutches silver tea pots porcelain creamers seltzer siphons glazed cheese crocks woven wood baskets and chairs from a Welsh chapel. All these flea-market triumphs give the dining room an ambient level of cuteness that is balanced by an Italian severity. Best of all the two chefs cook food that is deeply appealing without mugging. Ms. Sodi is a stickler about the pastas; like the meat and fish dishes they arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt any more complicated than they need to be.Izakaya,New York,East Village,An izakaya is an informal Japanese establishment neither quite restaurant nor tavern that treats eating as fortification for drinking. But Dai Watanabe the chef here is not content to be an accompanist. The mission may be comfort food but thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a reverence to its making even in the minor dishes. The soft-spoken waiter Yudai Kanayama who also happens to be one of IzakayaÍ¢‘„‘Žs owners has an uncanny ability to match each diner with a sake that suits and to gently explain the menuÍ¢‘„‘Žs digressions into Neapolitan cooking (a specialty of Mr. WatanabeÍ¢‘„‘Žs) and yoshoku Japanese Western-style cuisine.Patacon Pisao,,Lower East Side,The specialty here is patacÍ—‘_n the formidable sandwich of the city of Maracaibo Venezuela bookended not by bread but by unripe plantains that have been fried smashed and fried again. The small but sleek storefront traces its origins back to 2005 when Liliana Velazquez a native of Maracaibo started selling patacÍ—‘_nes out of a truck in Inwood Manhattan. Her elder son Jonathan Hernandez has expanded the menu from build-your-own patacÍ—‘_nes to Í¢‘„‘ñoriginal creations\u201d and given the space a modern sheen. But the food remains true to his motherÍ¢‘„‘ƒs cooking. And a framed photograph of the truck hangs on the wall: a reminder.Shuko,,Greenwich Village,Jimmy Lau and Nick Kim the chefs and owners rose to the top of Masa TakayamaÍ¢‘„‘Žs restaurant group. Occasionally they break out the kinds of guaranteed bell-ringers for which Mr. Takayama charges top dollar like caviar wagyu beef and truffles. Fat-streaked tuna belly prone on a bed of rice may be one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs at a cost of $135. In the $175 kaiseki meal a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital toro may reappear in the shape of a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of osetra caviar. WhatÍ¢‘„‘Žs impressive about Shuko though is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clichÍ—‘©d indulgences.Kao Soy,Brooklyn,Red Hook,Yes Kao Soy sells some of the dishes you know from your local Thai spot: the fried rice the pad Thai the curry with choice of chicken beef pork or shrimp. But its mission is to turn New Yorkers on to what Sirichai Sreparplarn one of the two chefs calls Í¢‘„‘ñthe real food from the North.\u201d The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy made in the style of Ms. SupachanaÍ¢‘„‘Žs father back in Chiang Mai. Kao Soy has some interesting ideas about what to drink with Thai food like cider from New Hampshire a Belgian-style saison ale from Maine or a red grenache from California. Patina,Bronx,Fairmont - Claremont Village,It can be an intimate if slightly disorienting experience dining at this very small West African restaurant in the Bronx. No menu is presented at least not in written form and only a few dishes are available at a time. But the food is delicious: earthy soups and stews over dense chewy rice and black-eyed peas with seams of heat from hidden Scotch bonnets. The walls are blank and the room uncozy; nevertheless I felt cherished as the waitress tucked up my sleeves to keep them clean and  warned only half-jokingly that if I didnÍ¢‘„‘Žt finish my food Í¢‘„‘ñWe fight.\u201dCosme,New York,Flatiron,The first New York restaurant from the acclaimed Mexican chef Enrique Olvera pulls off two tough moves at once. First its approach to Mexican cuisine is modern and relaxed but without the superficiality that might imply. Second it has a sharp instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner which isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt often the case with restaurants opened by chefs from abroad. Cosme is cool but it isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt trend-chasing. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs crowded and lively but it isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt painfully loud. Most of all the cooking is a thrill largely because it sails right over ideas like tradition authenticity and modernity. Many of the underpinnings come from Mexican while a lot of the ingredients were bought locally. The flavors are here and now though; you connect with the dishes right away.Sariling Atin,Queens,Elmhurst,From the outside Sariling Atin whose name in Tagalog means Í¢‘„‘ñour own\u201d looks like simply a small grocery with a Í¢‘„‘ñSend Money\u201d sign and the current Philippine peso exchange rate posted in the window. But past the shelves of egg cracklets and adobo-flavored corn nuts is a modest dining room where food is ordered turo-turo (point-point) style as in a cafeteria and spooned into plastic-foam bowls. On any given day there are fifteen chafing pans brimming with the likes of goat stew and pork steeped in coconut milk. Extra pans are balanced on top along with plates of fried whole fish crispy pork belly and banana-ketchup-glazed beef skewers which a glance around the room reveals that everyone has plundered.Blue Smoke,New York,Kips Bay,Since opening in 2002 Blue Smoke has always been a few paces behind the frontrunners of New York barbecue. But when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking Jean-Paul BourgeoisÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is at the head of the pack. Mr. Bourgeois was raised in Thibodaux La. and his best dishes are pulled dripping wet straight out of the bayou. Meanwhile the pickles and smoked meats on the Preservation Plate can summon thoughts of Frank Stitt or Hugh Acheson.LoLoÍ¢‘„‘Žs Seafood Shack,,Harlem,There is no grill on a sawed-off oil drum no lick of breeze or view of the sea in sun-shocked blue. But behind the frosted windows of LoLoÍ¢‘„‘Žs Seafood Shack the extemporaneous spirit of the lolo Í¢‘„‘î the kind of open-air barbecue joint found on the beaches and roadsides of St. Martin in the West Indies Í¢‘„‘î is strong. The married owners Leticia (Skai) Young and Raymond Mohan have roots in the Caribbean. And the food although served unceremoniously in cardboard boxes and aluminum bins is the work of a thoughtful chef: conch fritters with bright pops of fresh corn; chicken wings musky with achiote; snow crab legs in a coconut-milk curry that harks back to Mr. MohanÍ¢‘„‘Žs childhood in Guyana. North End Grill,New York,Battery Park City,North End Grill has more focus than in its early days. Eric KorshÍ¢‘„‘Žs cooking can look rustic but his embellishments betray a refined sensibility. The accompaniments bring some sheen to venerable classics of French charcuterie like pickled beef tongues or a jellied torchon of trotters. Vinegar sauce brings a civilized element to spatchcocked squab grilled to a bloody rare that looks primitive enough to get your heart pounding. Tracy ObolskyÍ¢‘„‘Žs desserts meanwhile are unabashedly American; one of the best is an ode in ice cream form to the Almond Joy.Plant Love House,Queens,Elmhurst,Before Manadsanan Sutipayakul opened Plant Love House her two daughters hosted informal lunches in their backyard to show off their motherÍ¢‘„‘Žs Thai cooking. When they went on hiatus friends kept calling and pleading for more food. At this cheerful unassuming storefront Ms. Sutipayakul is still cooking for the neighborhood: the clientele is mostly Thai the dishes comforting rather than showy. Her daughters make the desserts which include sizzling platters designed to make you gasp or giggle. The house rules written on the front door include Í¢‘„‘ñLaugh a lot\u201d Í¢‘„‘ñUse kind words\u201d and Í¢‘„‘ñBe positive grateful truthful.\u201d TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre easy to keep.BLVD Bistro,,Harlem,Carlos Swepson a New York chef with roots in Natchez Miss. is not reinventing the Southern-food wheel but he is trying to make it a smoother ride. His best food Í¢‘„‘î like wood-smoked chicken crisp wild grouper with a cornmeal crust and exemplary Southern potato salad (with chopped hard-boiled eggs) Í¢‘„‘î is pressed right up against tradition but tweaked for modern taste.  In the grand tradition of the Southern meat-and-three Mr. SwepsonÍ¢‘„‘Žs sides Í¢‘„‘î like collard greens red beans and rice and black-eyed peas -- are just as carefully seasoned as the mains.  At brunch perhaps the best meal here the light and shaggy biscuits collapse into a delicious heap under a weighty layer of scrambled eggs and melted Cheddar.  Not surprisingly he goes awry with the menu items that lean trendy not traditional: a kale Caesar salad of tough leaves glued together with a sticky salty dressing; short-rib tacos a random-seeming handful of chewy ingredients folded into raw-tasting tortillas; shrimp and grits gussied up with grilled undercooked jumbo shrimp.Upland,,Kips Bay,UplandÍ¢‘„‘Žs owner and impresario-in-chief Stephen Starr has opened jostling thumping nightclub-slash-restaurants as well as intimate stages for chefs. Upland occupies the middle ground a big restaurant that has enough set dressing to feel like an event without competing with the food. For the kitchen Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie whose intensely flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria won him national notice. At Upland he splashes around in the gentle sun-dappled river of classic California cuisine. The 96-seat dining room and vast menu would make some of his peers serenely accustomed to arranging brassica specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons collapse in a swoon. Lucky for us Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff.Kappo Masa,,Upper East Side,The chef Masa Takayama owns this restaurant with the art dealer Larry Gagosian who has provided the space in the basement of his Madison Avenue gallery. Mr. Takayama is known for sushi of course but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine so in addition to the raw-fish counter the well-populated kitchen has stations for grilling frying simmering steaming and assembling marinated seafood plates and cold salads. From time to time genuinely remarkable dishes do appear but often the raw ingredients are handled carelessly seasoned indifferently and served inattentively. And the cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally illogically relentlessly high and so out of proportion to any pleasure you might get that the prices become inescapable companions of your meal.Soy,,Lower East Side,Plenty of New York restaurants try to manufacture a sense of hominess but Soy feels like an actual offshoot of someoneÍ¢‘„‘Žs apartment. Crammed with odd debris (you canÍ¢‘„‘Žt miss the toy Godzilla on a shelf) it has occupied a sleepy cubbyhole on Suffolk Street for more than a decade and during those years the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef and owner Etsuko Kizawa has specialized in cooking her own gentle and maternal version of Japanese comfort food. On the surface Soy looks feels and smells like a vegetarian refuge and Ms. KizawaÍ¢‘„‘Žs daily specials often incorporate ingredients like beet greens pumpkin daikon and chrysanthemum leaves. Her vegetable dumplings are a sure thing displaying the correct balance of crispiness and chewiness. But meat is on the menu too and if you wander in on the right day Ms. Kizawa might be frying up her Í¢‘„‘ñeverything burger.\u201dThe Halal Guys,New York,East Village,A little over two decades ago a nameless food cart on the corner of 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas started serving platters of lamb and chicken slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law steeped in Middle Eastern spices and striped with a mysterious and mighty white sauce. Today this business officially named the Halal Guys comprises four carts and two restaurants in New York with franchises set to open around the country and abroad. On the brief menu the lamb is all sharply seasoned with just enough melting fat. What is in the white sauce we will never know and that is half the thrill. Sky Cafe,Queens,Elmhurst,Lily Tjia used to run a semi-secret catering company out of her home cooking for her neighbors in the growing Indonesian community of South Philadelphia. In 2010 she opened a restaurant in that city; four year later she moved to Elmhurst Queens and opened another. Sky Cafe has bamboo decals on the window and a dining room that fits barely five tables. Ms. Tjia is in the kitchen making superlatively tender beef rendang earthy home-made egg noodles and lontong sayur a red-gold coconut-milk soup.Dirty French,,Lower East Side,What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry the countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? The result might be something like Dirty French where the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone treat the food of France with a hugely energizing lack of respect.Hanamizuki,New York,Chelsea,At this Japanese cafe the rice balls (onigiri or omusubi in Japanese) are slightly offbeat as if sprung from a Haruki Murakami novel. A version called the Italian looks and tastes wholly Japanese with stray ticks of salt and vinegar but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs been infiltrated with salami olives and capers. Elsewhere there is bacon afloat in miso soup and gnocchi made with tofu and glutinous rice flour so they have bounce and squeak under the teeth. The menu is designed mostly for snacking. This is lovely to do in the soaring room white on all sides and lit by orbs covered in feathers with the mantra Í¢‘„‘ñTake a bite on beauty\u201d in old-timey script on the wall. Fitzcarraldo,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,A kind of magical loneliness possesses Fitzcarraldo which occupies a corner of a 30000-square-foot former warehouse in the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park. Music rains down from a gramophone horn embedded in the ceiling; spiky ferns half-spill out of hanging baskets; peacock-blue flowered tile runs underfoot. The gestures at beautiful decay come like the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name from Werner HerzogÍ¢‘„‘Žs 1982 film Í¢‘„‘ñFitzcarraldo\u201d in which a madman dreams of building an opera house in the Amazon. The food is Italian mostly Ligurian and lovely with one of the best renditions of cacio e pepe in town. Marta,,Midtown South,Pizza a lesser stop on RomeÍ¢‘„‘Žs culinary pilgrimage route is the main event of this pizzeria opened by the chef Nick Anderer. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs pure crunch all the way. Main courses are available but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Bar Bolonat,New York,West Village,Bar BolonatÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef and owner is Einat Admony who also has Balaboosta and the exemplary falafel chain TaÍ—‘èm. The white napkins polished stemware sheer curtains and understated modern furniture at Bar Bolonat are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. The daughter of Iranian and Yemenite exiles in Tel Aviv Ms. Admony combines the flavors she knew growing up with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York. Energetic seasoning drives her cuisine at Bar Bolonat and can be seen in dishes like shrimp in a Yemenite curry with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawa to soak up the spicy turmeric-gold coconut milk.Carnitas El Atoradero,Bronx,Mott Haven,Denisse Lina Chavez the chef and owner of Carnitas El Atoradero is an evangelist for her native countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs cuisine. She won a following cooking carnitas in her bodega next door; now with a proper kitchen she makes daily specials with traditional herbs and spices shipped by her sister from Mexico. The specials might include mole poblano made not with chocolate but with cacao beans and goat roasted over avocado criollo leaves until it takes on their licorice-like scent and flavor. After such heights the everyday taqueria menu is a bit of a letdown. Be warned sometimes only one or two specials are available but weekends bring more.Dumpling Galaxy,Queens,Flushing,As a young girl growing up in Tianjin China Helen You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents not in a culinary school or restaurant. After moving to New York she became a hero to the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs cheap-eats scavengers for her dumplings. Sturdy knobby domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition her dumplings are stuffed to order and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who really listens to her ingredients. At Dumpling Galaxy she offers 100 varieties along with an additional menu of dishes from Hunan Dongbei and Fujian.Hard Times Sundaes,Brooklyn,Mill Basin,At this food truck parked behind a WalgreenÍ¢‘„‘Žs in Mill Basin a neighborhood in southernmost Brooklyn the meat is fresh ground chuck not some proprietary blend of dry-aged Black Angus cuts. Sea salt and coarse black pepper are pressed in at the last minute. The bun is buttered and charred; the toppings are stacked with Pythagorean precision. None of this explains how good it is. For non-locals the journey here Í¢‘„‘î by subway then bus Í¢‘„‘î is long and worth it. Tuome,New York,East Village,Like so many other places in the era of Noma Tuome is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. In terms of glitz and glamour Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and ThoreauÍ¢‘„‘Žs cabin. You have probably eaten in dozens of rooms like this in the past few years and eaten dishes that look like the ones that the chef Thomas Chen is sending from the kitchen. Once the meal begins though it becomes clear that Mr. Chen has originality to spare and a clear fresh point of view particularly when he interprets Chinese cuisine. He has terrific control over salt spices texture and contrast weaving them together until you ask why hasnÍ¢‘„‘Žt anyone done this before?Blue Hill,New York,Greenwich Village,The chef Dan Barber is a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time with the pigs and the beans has had a deep lasting effect on the way he cooks. To get the Full Barber you have to go to Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills N.Y. for a $198 menu-free open-ended meal. New York City does not afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. BarberÍ¢‘„‘Žs complete vision but Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. BarberÍ¢‘„‘Žs long search for flavor pays off downtown where you find yourself thinking again and again that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind youÍ¢‘„‘Žve ever tasted. For this reason and others Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by.The Bao,,East Village,At this Manhattan outpost of Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao in Flushing Queens the soup dumplings or xiao long bao are near perfect: the skin is delicate but does not break and is ultra-thin less armor than envelope for the loose yielding meat and pork-stock broth. The rest of the menu is greatest-hits Chinese corralling Sichuan flamethrowers with old-school Cantonese. Much of this is delicious as are the unorthodox xiao long bao filled with dark liquid chocolate and a dab of banana recognized only in aftermath.Blenheim,New York,West Village,A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into BlenheimÍ¢‘„‘Žs food drinks and design but the pieces donÍ¢‘„‘Žt always fit together. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestoned streets Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. Rustic tools hang from the walls; underlining the point servers tell you that ingredients have been trucked in from the ownersÍ¢‘„‘Ž in Schoharie County. But the food as imagined by the chef Ryan Tate has as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. At times it is thoughtful transporting and intricate. At other times the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. Paet Rio,Queens,Elmhurst,For years Phimploy Likitsansook kept a secret menu at her HellÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen restaurant Wondee Siam written only in Thai and featuring specialties rarely found in Manhattan. At her latest venture in Elmhurst Queens thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs no need to be coy: the borough is home to more than half the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs Thai population with the largest concentration in the bocks surrounding Paet Rio. Ms. Likitsansook has brought over a few of her Wondee secrets but the execution is more focused the contours of flavor more distinct and a few dishes approach greatness.Arepa Lady,Queens,Corona,For more than two decades Maria Piedad Cano a.k.a. the Arepa Lady has parked her cart among the late-night roisterers of Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights Queens. Now her arepas are available at normal waking hours at a small restaurant opened by her sons Douglas Arevalo and Alejandro Osorio and Mr. OsorioÍ¢‘„‘Žs wife Nelly Klinger. The space is trim and more comfortable than need be given that the menu is as brief as the cartÍ¢‘„‘Žs and features only three types of arepas. Com Tam Ninh Kieu ,Bronx,Kingsbridge Heights,At Com Tam Ninh Kieu in the Bronx the murmur Í¢‘„‘î from the kitchen other tables the flatscreen TV Í¢‘„‘î is Vietnamese. The specialty is broken rice grains splintered in the milling process clingier and earthier than their grander polished cousins. The rest of the menu consists almost entirely of noodle soups including hard-to-find bun mam whose broth is dominated by fermented anchovies; banh mi bo kho close to a pot-au-feu; and pho with genuine clarity and dimension.Huertas,,East Village,Huertas is really two restaurants and two experiences under one roof. In the back is a small square dining room where the chef Jonah Miller serves a set menu of five courses. Some courses may be fresh sensitive interpretations of Basque classics while others are in a the familiar seasonally inspired mode thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs found elsewhere in New York. In the front of the restaurant is an inviting tapas bar where a different style of eating unfolds. Here the menu is a mix of cooked dishes with top-notch meats cheeses and canned Spanish seafood. Rather than ordering many things in a rush the preferred tactic is to start slow and wait for trays of small snacks to come around. If you say yes to one of these itÍ¢‘„‘Žs marked down on a card dim-sum style. This approach lets you start with drinks and see which way the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner.Cherche Midi,,Nolita,Cherche Midi may be Keith McNallyÍ¢‘„‘Žs most thorough repudiation of the downtown restaurant scene. The dining room turns its back on its corner lot creating an intimate cherry- and apricot-tone bistro with almost no street view. You could easily be on the Upper East Side. Music plays softly or not at all. Pretentiousness of the Í¢‘„‘ñlet me explain the menu\u201d variety is shunned. So is novelty. The kitchen does not aim to surprise; the chefs do not aim to be noticed. And guess what? ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs very easy to have a good time particularly if you stick to red meat and French wine.Old Tbilisi Garden,New York,Greenwich Village,If there is one Georgian dish that could bring Manhattan to its knees it is adjaruli khachapuri a thick flatbread with the ends tapered into blunt handles and the middle a cauldron of near-volcanic cheese with a yolk slowly setting on top. But Old Tbilisi Garden offers subtle pleasures as well: dishes suffused with summer savory coriander marigold and blue fenugreek like a musky more sensuous bouquet garni and grilled meat anointed with tkemali a sour-sweet sauce of unripe plums. The dining room is long and deep ending in a garden with a shushing waterfall trailing vines and lanterns tucked among the rocks. Abyssinia,New York,Harlem,Frehiwot Reta the chef and owner of Abyssinia has long been known among New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs Ethiopians as a master of injera the round sour flatbread more than a foot in diameter and riddled with sinkholes that is the base of every Ethiopian meal. She sold injera out of her Harlem apartment for a decade before opening this modest restaurant. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to single out dishes for recognition since they come in ensembles delivered in neighborly heaps along the circumference of one vast injera. But the flavors are notably distinct and intelligible and the spareness of the dining room dressed in little more than twinkle lights and plastic flowers feels reassuring. Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse,New York,Lower East Side,What happens at SammyÍ¢‘„‘Žs doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt happen at other restaurants and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament lightbulbs and salvaged barn beams; SammyÍ¢‘„‘Žs ManhattanÍ¢‘„‘Žs last surviving Roumanian-Jewish restaurant will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At SammyÍ¢‘„‘Žs your skirt steak called Roumanian tenderloin will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind if you want it medium or black and blue then write your request on a sheet of paper tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings Í¢‘„‘ñHappy Birthday.\u201d The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant too. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends not with Í¢‘„‘ñbon appÍ—‘©tit\u201d or Í¢‘„‘ñenjoy your meal\u201d but with Í¢‘„‘ñO.K. start eating.\u201dClaudette,,Greenwich Village,Caudette serves ProvenÍ—‘_al cuisine with an intelligent twist. Rather than treating the region as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world Í¢‘„‘î Peter MayleÍ¢‘„‘Žs Í¢‘„‘ñA Year in Provence\u201d repeated forever Í¢‘„‘î the kitchen casts a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there. Ras al hanout turns up on the bistro-style fries and the kitchen griddles an unleavened layered whole-wheat flatbread similar to Tunisian mlawi that is especially good smeared with pistou. ClaudetteÍ¢‘„‘Žs exploration of Provence can be undercut though by its impulse to play it safe to water down the pastis.Taste of Northern China,New York,Chinatown,At this stall-like storefront under the Manhattan Bridge the menu draws a wide map: smoky salty skewers heady with cumin and chile the flavors of Xinjiang ChinaÍ¢‘„‘Žs Wild West; cold gluten noodles muddled with sesame paste and vinegar and chewy bands in a hot-sour broth both from Shaanxi; muscular noodles doused with sesame oil from Hubei; beef noodle soup underscored by doubanjiang in the Sichuan style; and the now-ubiquitous Chinese burger slow-cooked half-collapsed pork stuffed in dense yet somehow still fluffy Uighur bread. There are only a few stools which feels exactly right. Barchetta,,Chelsea,David Pasternack the chef and a partner at Barchetta is one of the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times but not at all times. There are encouraging nights when Barchetta seems like the ideal downtown restaurant for people who really love the taste of fish. But when the kitchen loses its rhythm Barchetta can seem mired among all the also-rans.CafÍ—‘© Rue Dix,Brooklyn,Crown Heights,CafÍ—‘© Rue Dix is a restaurant firmly of the neighborhood but cosmopolitan in outlook mixing plates of French moules frites and Senegalese thiebou djeun spinning Edith Piaf between griot rap and mbalax. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs run by a local married couple: Lamine Diagne who grew up in Dakar (and borrowed the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipe for Scotch bonnet sauce from his mother) and Nilea Alexander who helped design the appealing space with geometric textile patterns and lamps made out of gourd drums. Feel free to mix and match cuisines and linger over profiteroles and attaya gunpowder green tea poured from a height.Bar Primi,New York,East Village,One of several reasons to like Bar Primi Andrew CarmelliniÍ¢‘„‘Žs new two-story restaurant on the corner of Second Street and the Bowery is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in Milan. Within Mr. CarmelliniÍ¢‘„‘Žs fleet Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of the Dutch than a big booming circus like Locanda Verde or Lafayette. Like all of those places and very much unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger Bar Primi has a wine list you could happily get lost in. There are 12 pastas on the menu and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating. Somewhat off the linguine theme but very much on the hangout theme there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich shaved thin and kicked into action with red-hot pepper relish. Moldova,Brooklyn,Midwood,At Moldova the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs one restaurant devoted to the cooking of the small former Soviet republic you might feel as if youÍ¢‘„‘Žd crashed a wedding and been immediately made welcome. The details are genuine as is the food: soups of primal sourness; mamaliga a cornmeal porridge that accompanies almost every entree; and baba neagra a dark fang of a cake traditionally made with chisleag or soured milk and flanked by sour cherry sauce in slashes. BÍ—‘¢tard,New York,TriBeCa,There are high spirits in BÍ—‘¢tardÍ¢‘„‘Žs dining room which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. Markus GlockerÍ¢‘„‘Žs cooking plays well with others and his flexible Í—‘_ la carte menu encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers it will be impossible not to order Burgundy at a restaurant called BÍ—‘¢tard although noncomformists will find blue-chip Napa Valley wines and a deep  pocket of whites from Alsace Germany and Austria where Mr. Glocker was born. BÍ—‘¢tard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the poussin schnitzel a special in perpetuity and the Sacher torte a special on occasion. Both are classical the chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. Elsewhere on the menu Mr. Glocker explores other flavors and regions but the complexity of his plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking. Delaware and Hudson ,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Delaware and Hudson looks the part of the contemporary Brooklyn restaurant that preaches all things local and seasonal. The walls are pinned with glamour shots of farmersÍ¢‘„‘Ž market bins piled with strawberries and purple-tipped asparagus. The cooking stands out from the pack though in part because they draw on the traditions of long-gone Americans who would have been amazed to hear that farm-to-table would become a slogan one day. Old-time mid-Atlantic recipes (Í¢‘„‘ñfrom Baltimore to Buffalo\u201d says a sign by the door) flit on and off the weekly menus along with contemporary seasonal cooking and some Italian-style pasta. Indian Road Cafe,New York,Inwood,For anyone who doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt happen to live in this Manhattan neighborhood which is so far north that it brushes against the backside of the Bronx wandering into Indian Road Cafe is like discovering a secret hideaway. The cafe has quietly evolved into an unpretentious clubhouse and on any given night itÍ¢‘„‘Žs abuzz with music and bonhomie. In the culinary tug-of-war between innovation and familiarity the chef Nicholas Wright-Bodine pulls tenaciously for Team Comfort.The Bronx Beer Hall,Bronx,Belmont,The Bronx Beer Hall is a noble effort to coax some youthful energy into one of New York CityÍ¢‘„‘Žs legendary Italian-American neighborhoods. And itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a lovely place to loaf nibbling on terrifically lip-searing chicken wings and sipping from a well-chilled selection of local brews. Much of the pub grub is disappointingly off though. Skip the gristly pork sliders and the mushy misguided truffle burger and steer toward the sandwiches from Mike's Deli the Greco family's counter a few yards away.Ivan Ramen,New York,Lower East Side,Ivan Orkin the Long Island-born chef who made his name cooking ramen in Tokyo comes home with a restaurant that shows his breadth as a chef. He skillfully and energetically colors outside the lines of Japanese food with cultural allusions that come fast quick and from several directions at once. Hot ramen isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt the only thing to eat and it isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt necessarily the most interesting; in the early days it was served below ideal temperature. But other dishes are fully realized especially the dry-style ramen called mazemen of which Mr. Orkin is the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs reigning master. Lumpia Shack Snackbar,New York,West Village,At Lumpia Shack Snackbar Neil Syham the chef makes pretty but still potent versions of Filipino classics like sisig Í¢‘„‘î a hash of pig ears jowls and belly brined blanched shattered and fried. He turns crispy pata traditionally half a pigÍ¢‘„‘Žs leg deep-fried whole into fries. The storefront is minimalist. There are just a few stools along the counter which is too bad because this is food best eaten on the spot.Brooklyn Ball Factory,East Williamsburg Brooklyn ,Williamsburg,There are prettier outdoor dining spaces in the city but few with quite the juxtaposition of serenity and grit as the rooftop at Brooklyn Ball Factory a Japanese comfort food and coffee shop in East Williamsburg. The titular meatballs along with the likes of shabu-shabu-style pork and misoyaki salmon come in nicely tricked out bento boxes with excellent pickles and nothing surpasses $12.Russ &amp; Daughters Cafe,New York,Lower East Side,The new Russ &amp; Daughters Cafe is modeled to an almost obsessive degree on the old Russ &amp; Daughters shop a few blocks away on East Houston Street. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket just as at the original. But the cafe adds to elaborates on and deviates from the store in ways that make it a three-dimensional restaurant not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the originalÍ¢‘„‘Žs popularity. Racines NY ,New York,TriBeCa,Racines NY is a branch of one of ParisÍ¢‘„‘Žs most influential wine bars. It has very little in common with the original but it has virtues of its own. For one thing itÍ¢‘„‘Žs not really a wine bar; itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a restaurant or Í¢‘„‘ñneo-bistro\u201d in the ownerÍ¢‘„‘Žs term. The cooking is brought to a pitch of refinement thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs at odds with the wine bar spirit and the menu is designed more for dining that snacking while you talk about how extremely well priced that bottle of Chinon is. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs charms do not include its dÍ—‘©cor. While New Yorkers have come to expect every French restaurant to evoke Paris; this one might have come out of a spread in the Restoration Hardware catalog.The Gander,New York,Flatiron,Jesse Schenker the GanderÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef had a breakout hit in 2010 with his debut restaurant Recette where the room is noisy and cramped and the cooking sharp at times coruscating. The Gander is more relaxed in ambition aiming to be a neighborhood joint. Too bad itÍ¢‘„‘Žs trapped in the body of a high-end restaurant with prim sconces over-bright lights and an aura of being slightly tranquilized. Grindhaus,Brooklyn ,Red Hook,Aaron Taber the chef at Grindhaus makes the kind of earnest fashionably austere handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients with no capital letters verbs articles or hint of how one thing might relate to the next. In some restaurants they donÍ¢‘„‘Žt relate; at Grindhaus they do. Mr. TaberÍ¢‘„‘Žs style of cooking is often found in druidic wood-filled restaurants with painfully earnest names derived from natural materials like Resin. Grindhaus isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt as high-minded as those places. It has some rock Í¢‘„‘ƒnÍ¢‘„‘Ž roll in its trousers. A steel silhouette of a  broken wine glass has been painted in the front window and the jagged shards  attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. Khao Kang,Elmhurst Queens,Elmhurst,At Khao Kang there is no menu or wait service. Food is premade and presented cafeteria style. The steam-table joint is based on an honorable and beloved class of eatery in Thailand known as raan khao kaeng or rice-curry shop. The chef and owner Sopon Kosalanan who emigrated to the United States from eastern Thailand cooks alongside his mother and his aunt.Chayhana Salom,Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn,Sheepshead Bay,Chayhana SalomÍ¢‘„‘Žs charming dining room is clean and bright behind its slightly grubby storefront. Food is served on formal china with glimmers of gilt. Every meal should include patir so gorgeously fluffy it hardly merits the term flatbread; samsa packed loosely so the ground lamb filling falls apart instantly in the mouth; chewy hand-stretched lagman noodles; and plov UzbekistanÍ¢‘„‘Žs national dish here made in the style of Tashkent the ownersÍ¢‘„‘Ž hometown.Uma's, Rockaway Park Queens,The Rockaways,UmaÍ¢‘„‘Žs may be the only Uzbek restaurant in the United States with surfboard parking the Velvet Underground blaring and organic kale salad as an occasional special. It is owned by Conrad Karl and his wife Umida known as Uma who is also the chef and is from Samarkand Uzbekistan. Ms. KarlÍ¢‘„‘Žs dishes are friendly and accessible as is the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs laid-back urban-beach decor with a photograph of Duke Kahanamoku on the wall and a childÍ¢‘„‘Žs surfboard leaning in a corner Í¢‘„‘î belonging to the KarlÍ¢‘„‘Žs daughter already a surf champion.Baoburg,Brooklyn ,Williamsburg,BaoburgÍ¢‘„‘Žs idiosyncratic menu owes as much to classical European technique as it does to the cross-cultural upbringing of the chef Suchanan Aksornnan (known as Bao Bao) who grew up in northern Thailand came to New York at age 15 and started cooking alongside her mother at a Thai restaurant in Williamsburg Brooklyn. Prunes cowled in bacon are adorned with eel sauce mayonnaise and bonito flakes in the style of Japanese takoyaki; lemon grass and kaffir lime infiltrate gambas al ajillo; crispy Chinese egg noodles share a bowl with chewy Italian linguine. This isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt globe-trotting for its own sake; the best dishes have both whimsy and logic.Tavern on the Green,New York,Upper West Side,Compared with its last days before its death of insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies Tavern on the Green is much much improved. The building constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of the Sheep Meadow has been woven into the life of Central Park again. But two months after opening the kitchen was still struggling to serve the 350 seats indoors and another 350 outside. A Voce Madison ,New York,Midtown South,No longer as imperative as it was under A VoceÍ¢‘„‘Žs founding chef Andrew Carmellini the cooking at A Voce Madison has taken an understated turn that still offers a rewarding spin on modern Italian cuisine.Houdini Kitchen Laboratory,Queens,Bushwick,At this pizzeria in a former brewery on the border between Bushwick Brooklyn and Ridgewood Queens ceilings are 15 feet high windows 9. Flames rear up inside a wood-fired pizza oven on the far wall. Floors are concrete under long-stemmed hooded lamps and communal tables meant for 10. The pies have tooth bending without flopping staying chewy all the way to the knobby outer rim; they are uniformly excellent and occasionally achieve transcendence. There is no sign and the entrance through a fence at the back of the building is unmarked. But Houdini isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt an of-the-moment speakeasy; it is simply and wonderfully a restaurant with good food and earnest intent that just happens to be in one of the coolest spaces in the city.Flinders Lane,New York,East Village,ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a genial ambiculturalism at play at this modern Australian restaurant which shows clear affection for English tradition while reaching across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea for more fervent flavors and celebrating Í¢‘„‘ñbush tucker\u201d indigenous foods like Tasmanian mountain pepper berry wattle seed and Anzac biscuits. The dÍ—‘©cor pays homage to the gritty history of Flinders Lane a former rag-trade district in Melbourne.Gato,New York,NoHo,The first new restaurant Bobby Flay and his business partner Laurence Kretchmer have opened in New York City in a decade Gato is nominally Mediterranean but the chef rides herd on pastas and pizzas and romesco sauces with a go-for-broke intensity thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs 100 percent American. Mr. Flay brushes flavor on his ingredients in thick impasto strokes making each plate a three-dimensional aggregation of char smoke capsicum sugar acid and fat. The cooking at Gato is many things often all at the same time but it is rarely shy.Spicy Lanka,Jamaica Queens,Jamaica Hills,The murals on Spicy LankaÍ¢‘„‘Žs walls and ceiling Í¢‘„‘î of blue sky banana fronds and distant birds with eyelash wings Í¢‘„‘î were painted by Pratheepan Selvachandran who runs the restaurant with his wife Marie De Silva;  both are natives of Sri Lanka. The menu is terse and cryptic; best just to ask for recommendations like pittu squat columns of roasted rice flour steamed with pandan leaves and adorned with icing-white curls of coconut or string hoppers flat pale nests of skinny rice-flour noodles used to scoop up thin yellow curry that drips through the noodlesÍ¢‘„‘Ž mesh and down the fingers.The Simone,New York,Upper East Side,A classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century the Simone has the kind of textured lived-in analog warmth that has become rare in ManhattanÍ¢‘„‘Žs increasingly corporatized professionalized restaurant scene. Tina Vaughn an owner who presides over the dining room takes down reservations in an actual book with an actual pen the same tool she uses to write the menu in cursive each time it changes. Though expensive and formal with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths the restaurant isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt starchy at all. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a living breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the new ProvenÍ—‘_al rosÍ—‘© sheÍ¢‘„‘Žs about to uncork while her husband Chip Smith channels his pride into the cooking. Mr. Smith works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 or 20 years ago. He is not rewriting the rules of French cooking; itÍ¢‘„‘Žs simply the language he speaks and heÍ¢‘„‘Žs fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world. Box Kite,New York,East Village,At night this speck of a coffee shop serves an 8-to-10-course tasting menu at a counter with creaky swivel chairs cater-corner to a kitchen improvised out of a couple of induction burners and what one of the chefs describes as Í¢‘„‘ña glorified toaster oven.\u201d The $85 prix fixe while an investment isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt the enervating marathon that tastings at much higher price points can be. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs more summer playlist than Í¢‘„‘ñRing\u201d cycle a tumble of ideas that intrigue and vanish delightful precisely because they are fleeting. The chefs take turns presenting dishes rattling off a litany of ingredients with such genial nonchalance that the repeated phrase Í¢‘„‘ñfreshly foraged\u201d doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt come across as precious. Many a sauce is sluiced tableside sometimes with a touch too much exuberance but the spills feel like part of the show. Narcissa ,New York,East Village,The chef John Fraser is known for his refined thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa in the Standard East Village hotel are more unbuttoned and generous. TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre complex but in a relaxed way that fits this casual many-things-to-many-people dining room where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses. The vegetables have a swaggering originality that arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt always matched by the meat and seafood dishes some of which seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who donÍ¢‘„‘Žt want any back-talk from their dinner. Eim Khao Mun Kai,Elmhurst Queens,Elmhurst,At Eim Khao Mun Kai the only dish on the menu is khao man gai a sort of punkified cover version of Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken is organic poached whole with ginger and comes with gizzards and liver. But it is mere garnish for the rice which is gilded with chicken fat skimmed off the top of the poaching liquid and then cooked in the broth and sluiced with a sauce adrenalized by birdÍ¢‘„‘Žs eye chilies and fermented yellow soybean paste. Between bites a bowl of the broth offers a cleansing reprieve.Khao Man Gai NY,Long Island City Queens,Long Island City,Emorn Henshaw who grew up in northeast Thailand spent two years perfecting her recipe for khao man gai (literally translated as chicken fat rice) before she and her husband Eric started serving it at artisanal food markets. The chicken is silky and appears without skin or offal. The rice is loose and perfumed with pandan leaves with only a hint of chicken fat and the sauce is more sweet than spicy. The soup is delicate verging on transparent. As a meal it is subtle and wholesome although you miss a little of the dishÍ¢‘„‘Žs traditional thrilling heat.River Cafe,Brooklyn,Fulton Ferry,No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River CafÍ—‘© does. And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn BridgeÍ¢‘„‘Žs steel underbelly than of their plates the food is still much better than you might fear if youÍ¢‘„‘Žve been to other restaurants with souvenir views.El Quinto Pino,New York,Chelsea,A short Í¢‘„‘ñmenu turistico\u201d investigates a different region of the country every few months which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that might hit the permanent roster. Other than that the tapas arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt tied down to any one Spanish region or even to Spain itself; the sandwiches roam as far afield as Mexico and New Orleans. Seafood is appealing and out of the ordinary with rarely-seen items like fried sea anemone in scrambled eggs. The thirty seats in the dining room feel romantic but not in an obvious way. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a room meant for talking.Dotory,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Dotory is a tiny mostly serene bastion of quiet eccentricity under the J M and Z tracks in East Williamsburg Brooklyn. Few are the restaurants equipped with both a faux fireplace complete with electric log and in the bathroom a thumbtacked Balthus print and a book of paintings by Camille Bombois. Pink-tipped paper lanterns fringe the windows; utensils are slung in coffee cans. The owner Haegeen Kim a native of Seoul is something of an accidental chef having gone from art school to waiting tables to the kitchen. Her best dishes are the ones truest to her heritage like crackly-edged pa jun and kimchi fried rice dishes to soothe a drunk.Cagen,New York,East Village,Toshio Tomita the chef and owner worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa and he has his mentorÍ¢‘„‘Žs ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions. One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned non-interventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients especially the fish he brings in from Japan are often exceptional. But then there are little flavor bombs from unexpected sources like the chimichurri made with shiso yuzu and no small dose of jalapeÍ—‘±o for basting on slices of pliant tender sashimi. An omakase meal brings a rare treat the cold soba noodles made from buckwheat flour that Mr. Tomita grinds by hand between stones the size of a birdbath. Ristorante Morini,New York,Upper East Side,Most of the food here is as carefully prepared and well-considered food as any that Michael WhiteÍ¢‘„‘Žs Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. The seafood tends to outshine the other options but you should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi; the pastas which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert overseen by AltamareaÍ¢‘„‘Žs corporate pastry chef Robert Truitt. What you wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt get is a solid argument for eating here rather than at another Altamarea venue; if you want refined expensive seafood you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at MareaKung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,New York,Clinton,The specialty at this bare-bones shop is ramen in its original form as it first came to Japan from China: la mian or hand-pulled noodles which are as much theater as comfort food. The chef Peter Song a former actor in China smiles sunnily from a kitchen window as he stretches and swings dough in great spinning slurs. His noodles are chewy dense and so delicious that the soup they swim in seems almost superfluous. Other necessities on the menu include steamed buns (better known in the West as soup dumplings) and thick pleated mantou with pork and gelatin liquefying inside. Telepan Local,New York,TriBeCa,Telepan Local offers almost none of the virtues of small-plates eating with most of the drawbacks. The meal unfolds or unravels on tables the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where in another era people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Í¢‘„‘ñWeÍ¢‘„‘Žre a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant\u201d my server said one night. Í¢‘„‘ñAll the food is small plates that you can share.\u201d In fact many plates are too small for even one person. Many of them are sensitively made from great ingredients but they are a bit too well-mannered for this style of dining.Parmys Persian Fusion,New York,Upper East Side,Never mind the fusion in the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name. The mostly classical Persian dishes come from MomÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipes according to the brother-and-sister owners: dense rich stews respectably charred kebabs and gloriously tahdig made with lavash spread beneath rice in a heavy pan and brought nearly to a scorch so it arrives with blackened tips and crunchy seams of flattened rice that pop under the teeth.Jean-Georges,New York,Upper West Side,A radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining when it opened in 1997 Jean-Georges can still surprise even in its comfortable middle age. The restaurant glides like a Mercedes sedan but its chef and founder Jean-Georges Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. His disciplined skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is his foremost talent. Most of the time you couldnÍ¢‘„‘Žt take something away from one his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. For anyone feeling left behind by the fashion for scattershot disputatious desserts the multi-part variations created by Joseph Murphy the pastry chef will be an answered prayer. Lucky Luna,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,At Lucky Luna a Mexican-Taiwanese restaurant the two cuisines of its hyphenated premise are mostly neighborly but distinct: posole and tacos here congee and steamed bao buns there. But there is more ambition and finesse than the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs underdressed dining room and low-key snack-ish menu might suggest. The excitement lies in unexpected details like a house-made hot sauce that starts off Chinese with a hit of vinegar and finishes Mexican with a swaggering heat.Mountain Bird,,East Harlem,Mountain Bird an idiosyncratic almost-all-poultry restaurant is curious and endearing with eyelash-fringed rooster lamps an abbreviated lace curtain strung mid-window and gilded-edge plates monogrammed MB in gold. The chef Kenichi Tajima works in the kitchen without prep or line cooks while his wife Keiko waits tables alone; their efforts reach heroic levels on nights when the dining room brims over. The menu is strongest when it surprises as with a phyllo cigarillo packed with chicken gizzard and heart or a double-decker cheesecake baked on the bottom and Í¢‘„‘ñrare\u201d on top.The Peacock,New York,Midtown South,The William a boutique hotel offers two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. Upstairs is the Peacock a civilized grown-up restaurant where Ray Charles shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly non-denominational. One floor below is the Shakespeare. The two spots share a kitchen a chef named Robert Aikens and a number of appealingly traditional dishes done with care. The Shakespeare,New York,Midtown East,The William a boutique hotel offers two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. Upstairs is the Peacock. One floor below is the Shakespeare a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack soccer on both televisions and a network of taps for British lagers and cask ales. The two spots share a kitchen a chef named Robert Aikens and a number of appealingly traditional dishes done with care. Il Salumaio,New York,Upper East Side,Il Salumaio started out as an old-world salumeria offering takeout-only sandwiches and pasta made to order with nowhere to sit and eat. Customers complained and the owners the brothers Fabio and Siro Casella from Salerno Italy shrank the deli counter and filled the rest of the narrow space with tables. Now Fabio turns out satisfyingly nostalgic Italian fare: perfect arancini with the thinnest possible crispy shell; meatballs deep-fried then baked tender and firm at once; and robust mostly red-sauce pasta. The flavors are direct effective age-old. RÍ—‘‰tisserie Georgette,New York,Upper East Side,There is a real Georgette (the owner Georgette Farkas) and a real rotisserie. In fact there are two rotisseries loaded up with pudgy chickens small flocks of stuffed quail and dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches. If Rotisserie Georgette had a clock its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out. Contra,New York,Lower East Side,Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske have a personal understated modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest. They share an approach to cooking that is catching on among other young chefs some of whose food gets lumped in with the New Nordic movement. A more accurate name for their quiet naturalistic drama-averse approach might be mumblecore cuisine. Contra pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following.Sushi Katsuei,Brooklyn,Park Slope,In Brooklyn sushi bars have tended to hover at the level of the neighborhood joint Í¢‘„‘î that is until Sushi Katsuei opened on a corner of Park Slope. Forgive the bare walls blunt lighting and the presence of California and spicy tuna rolls on the menu. Beautiful pristine sushi comes omakase (the chef decides) starting at just $45. The approach is classical the lineup one all-star after another delivered by the three presiding chefs with an economy of motion and occasionally a slip of a smile.Rusty Mackerel,New York,Washington Heights,At this narrow cheerful restaurant in Washington Heights the flavors are mainly Mediterranean with the occasional high-concept dish like a burger thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs a cross between a Dominican chimi and a British butty. Wallflower,New York,West Village,Wallflower waits in the shadows just off Greenwich Avenue without a sign barely exhaling light. Inside the space is tight in that way called bijou two brief rooms under a tin ceiling painted gold. The elegant occasionally roguish cocktails are overseen by Xavier Herit who spent seven years as head bartender at Daniel; the elegant occasionally roguish bistro fare comes from Jared Stafford-Hill previously at Adour Alain Ducasse and Maison Premiere. Dhaulagiri Kitchen,Queens,Maspeth,Dhaulagiri Kitchen whose name appears nowhere outside this shack of a storefront shares a cramped chaotic space with a chapati bakery. The disheveled setting is part of the charm as is the gruff warmth of the chef and owner Kamala Gauchan who makes beef jerky in-house delights in Í¢‘„‘ñhard\u201d (i.e. tough) chicken curries and turns uncooked instant ramen into an unexpectedly thrilling snack. Mission Cantina,New York,Lower East Side,The chef Danny Bowien is committed to keeping his restaurants within reach of the non-rich. Mission Cantina his nonconformist Mexican restaurant charges under $10 for almost everything on the menu and gives away sparkling water. For those prices you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt grumble too loudly when a dish fizzles. And while some of the food can be remarkable and original a surprising number of things do fizzle on this menu a book of wet matches from a chef who can make sparks shoot from his fingertips. Bergen Hill ,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,In a kitchen that measures three feet by five feet Andrew DÍ¢‘„‘ŽAmbrosi turns out sophisticated and often surprising plates of seafood. At this small vaguely old-timey establishment the details elevate: cold-smoked lardo liquefying over ribbons of squid in pomodoro; octopus slow-poached and caramelized until it tastes like barbecue; croutons in a kale salad toasted Í—‘_ la minute so they arrive still warm.Gotham West Market,New York,Clinton,To lure renters to Gotham West a 1238-unit apartment complex the developer tried to bring forth a troop of places to eat in a patch of HellÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen that had almost none. Some of the mini-restaurants in Gotham West Market are geared for locals. For visitors coming from farther away the standouts are Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop for deeply flavorful ramens in the traditional soup style and the more recent dry Í¢‘„‘ñmazemen\u201d style; El Colmado run by the chef Seamus Mullen which is true to the spirit and flavors of a Spanish tapas bar; Little Chef for carefully prepared eggs and sandwiches from Caroline Fidanza a founder of the Brooklyn restaurant scene; and the Cannibal with house-made charcuterie and a deep trove of beers well worth exploring. With an unusual degree of imagination Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing Queens.Annisa,New York,West Village,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs not easy to sum up Anita LoÍ¢‘„‘Žs style which adroitly mixes ideas from around the world. The label she came up with when naming her cookbook was Í¢‘„‘ñCooking Without Borders.\u201d What is remarkable about her food though is not exactly the absence of borders but the ease with which she crosses them. She can borrow elements of four distinct cuisines and weave them into a single dish that feels completely unified. Though she is known for her Asian leanings the hallmark of her cuisine is the way she couples her free-range curiosity with an unerring instinct for exciting flavorsM. Wells Steakhouse,Long Island City,Long Island City,Discipline is not the strong suit of M. Wells Steakhouse for better and for worse. It can lurch from magnificence to sloppiness from inspired fever dreams to inarticulate notions that arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt ready to leave the kitchen. One thing that needs improvement is the steaks. This isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt as fatal as youÍ¢‘„‘Žd think because when M. Wells Steakhouse succeeds it does so in a deeply satisfying fashion by feeding the lust in your gut for a meal that is not just a dinner but a feast.Yun Nan Flavour Garden ,Brooklyn,Borough Park,Yun Nan Flavour Garden was formerly Yun Nan Flavour Snack a primarily takeout shop off Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park the heart of BrooklynÍ¢‘„‘Žs Chinatown. Now it occupies a proper restaurant space a few blocks over with chandeliers large round tables and a longer (if not yet fully realized) menu that includes hard-to-find crossing-the bridge-noodles alongside its greatest hits: perfect dumplings lucid soups and house-made rice noodles with bounce and bite.Han Dynasty,New York,East Village,Han ChiangÍ¢‘„‘Žs chain of Sichuan restaurants has been so popular in and around Philadelphia that Mr. Chiang plans to open 100 locations around the country. There are quite a few towns where this would be great news but Manhattan has far better Sichuan kitchens. Han DynastyÍ¢‘„‘Žs translation of the cuisine has a thick American accent relying heavily on sugar bell peppers and excessive amounts of MSG. Many of the main courses come across as close relatives of the kung pao chicken made by the best Chinese takeout in your neighborhood. The appetizers are by and large a less cloying and more appealing crew. Hirohisa,New York,SoHo,The cooking at Hirohisa is very Japanese in the let-the-ingredients-speak mode that can leave some Americans cold. Some of the grilled meat dishes for instance leave a smaller impression in the memory than on the bill. But elsewhere on the menu Hirohisa Hayashi the chef brings out the whispering harmonies that result when one small wave of flavor laps against another. Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter. You wait a glass of sake in hand while you watch dinner being made as if you were sitting in a friendÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen.The East Pole,New York,Upper East Side,The East Pole is the uptown spinoff of the vaguely British fashion-crowd canteen the Fat Radish on the Lower East Side. The East Pole unfurls over two floors of a prewar townhouse. A few of the Fat RadishÍ¢‘„‘Žs greatest hits are reprised Í¢‘„‘î fries confit in duck fat a soft-boiled Scotch egg Í¢‘„‘î but the loveliest dishes revolve around vegetables. The Bistro at Villard Michel Richard,Manhattan,Midtown East,Villard Michel Richard the latest restaurant to dance among the frescoes and marble pillars of the Villard mansion in Midtown could be taken as homage to awful hotel dining rooms. Mr. RichardÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu ranges from inept versions of dishes he first served elsewhere to letter-perfect versions of terrible banquet cuisine from decades past. Only two things break the illusion: the wine list and the desserts. Both are excellent.McSorley's Old Ale House,New York,East Village,As ancient lyrical dust-caked gimcrack-packed sawdust-carpeted shrines go McSorleyÍ¢‘„‘Žs just might be the best in New York City Í¢‘„‘î and arguably the entire U.S. This legend-making saloon which was established in 1854 and was later memorialized in print by the laureate of the metropolitan underbelly Joseph Mitchell still serves as a fine place to sneak away from your troubles on a sleepy afternoon. You canÍ¢‘„‘Žt go wrong with the burger which is simple and juicy or a bowl of chili or the cheese plate that comes with a sheaf of crackers straight out of the box. Chairs can be wobbly and service can be cheerfully surly in a way that calls to mind the early films of Martin Scorsese but this is New York pal and you didnÍ¢‘„‘Žt come here for Í¢‘„‘ñnice.\u201dKorchma Taras Bulba,New York,SoHo,Sometimes a lot of strong liquor and a little rich food are just the thing and the Ukrainian fare at Taras Bulba has the combination nailed. House-infused vodkas in flavors like ginger cranberry lemon and chile cut through platefuls of dumplings stuffed with cheese onions and mushrooms; platters of smoked fish and the Ukrainian national dish of salo salt-cured pork belly. The first U.S. outpost of a popular chain in Moscow and Kiev the Soho space has been transformed into a Slavic-bucolic theme park decorated with farm implements and homespun table linens; the servers wear folkloric dress and are among the friendliest in this neighborhood. So are the prices.Toro,New York,Chelsea,Toro opened by the chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette and based on their enduringly popular Boston original has factory-height ceilings an industrial-chic design and 120 seats at long communal tables and smaller unshared ones. It isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt all that large by the standards of West Chelsea and the meatpacking district but compared with the cozy Barcelona tapas joints that inspired it Toro might as well be a Home Depot. It sells almost as many items. The beverage list alone is a major treatise on Spanish drinking and the menu gives you something like 60 choices. Some are fully traditional Spanish classics; others are non-Iberian interpretations like yellowfin tuna in white soy sauce with tissue-thin vinegared cucumbers. A surprisingly large portion of the menu is excellent and the seafood in particular can be spectacular. ToroÍ¢‘„‘Žs food isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt stagy or gimmicky; it's honest and thoughtful but it can feel a bit lost in this space. There are times when eating tapas here is like watching card tricks at Yankee Stadium. Onomea,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,At Onomea the food is all the more exotic for being almost familiar. There is no chef; the owner Crystalyn Costa who grew up in Hilo Hawaii taught the cooks her familyÍ¢‘„‘Žs recipes. Spam the prefab-pink luncheon meat gets pride of place This is humble food served in a dining room that suggests a sauna in the middle of a rain forest.The Musket Room,New York,Nolita,At the Musket Room Matt Lambert a native of Auckland prepares New Zealand food that is ambitious and meticulously detailed. He works best in miniature and serves what may be the daintiest 10-course tasting menu in town. The space  has a warm easy elegance with curved elbow chairs ultramarine banquettes and walnut tables with unmilled edges.Larb Ubol,New York,Midtown West,To a passer-by there is little to distinguish Larb Ubol from the 30 or so pad-Thai joints that are its neighbors in HellÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen. But the chef and owner Ratchanee Sumpatboon does not cook the Thai food most Americans know Í¢‘„‘î the elaborate rich dishes of central Thailand flooded with coconut milk. She grew up in Isan ThailandÍ¢‘„‘Žs northeast region and one of the countryÍ¢‘„‘Žs poorest areas where the cuisine is plain-spoken and resourceful. At times her flavors achieve remarkable lucidity. And although chiles are plentiful firepower is just a facet not the dominating factor in a dish.Sushi Nakazawa,New York,West Village,The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Daisuke Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses and when itÍ¢‘„‘Žs gone you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. Each slice of fish has a slightly different temperature which affects flavor and texture -- whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassinÍ¢‘„‘Žs aim locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb. He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under tuna bringing out its bloody-lip tang and a paste of yuzu peel and burning chiles bites playfully into the cool sweetness of a scallop lopped from its shell just a minute before itÍ¢‘„‘Žs served its edges still fluttering. That scallop dish is distinctively his and once youÍ¢‘„‘Žve had it youÍ¢‘„‘Žd know it anywhere.Charlie Bird,New York,SoHo,Charlie Bird has the slightly-too-crowded and slightly-too-loud spirit that keeps people living in New York even while they gripe about it. The narrow space essentially a split-level bowling alley has squash-colored banquettes and Lyle OwerkoÍ¢‘„‘Žs blown-up photographs of vintage boom boxes shot like Avedon portraits. The music is carefully aged hip-hop. Charlie Bird is on a mission to make the thoughtful wine service that you used to find only in hushed special-occasion restaurants into an everyday event. Even the cheapest bottles are exciting but if your curiosity outstrips your budget you can get a half bottle of something more expensive for half its listed price. The cooking can be surprisingly erratic: tremendously likable one moment strangely off-key the next. But at its best it masters an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese salt and crunch.Martha,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,Martha in Fort Greene Brooklyn has a homey built-by-hand back story. The owners Andres Valbuena (chef) and his fiancÍ—‘©e Melissa Gorman (front of the house) started out hosting an occasional supper club in Mr. ValbuenaÍ¢‘„‘Žs apartment four years ago. Last fall they took over a storefront on DeKalb Avenue and opened the Brooklyn Sandwich Society. In August the restaurant was rechristened Martha. At their best Mr. ValbuenaÍ¢‘„‘Žs dishes have the noisy forthrightness of good garage rock. Ellary's Greens,New York,West Village,EllaryÍ¢‘„‘Žs Greens is not so much a restaurant as dining rehab. The menu is devoted to natural and organic foods and from such a place you expect mere nourishment not pleasure. But Leith Hill the owner is serious about closing the divide between good-for-you and delicious. The chef Alex Oefeli serves modest but vividly detailed dishes made from local and often organic ingredients.Somtum Der,New York,East Village,Called som tum in Thailand papaya salad gives this nearly three-month-old restaurant its name and is its star attraction made to order in eight variations. Papaya salad is essential to building a meal of tastes from Isan ThailandÍ¢‘„‘Žs northeast whose cuisine Somtum Der highlights. Sticky rice is essential too as are the rustic fiery salads called larbs. Very few dishes cost more than $12 and this is one restaurant where the refrain of Í¢‘„‘ñsmall plates meant for sharing\u201d is not just accurate but culturally appropriate so order as many as the table can hold. Piora ,New York,West Village,Piora isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt large. The tables are leather-topped as if you were about to sit down for a hand of whist and they are hemmed in so snugly that when servers converged to set down three plates at once they looked like they were playing Twister. Design tricks make the room look larger than it is though and you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt notice the tight quarters once dinner begins. Chris CipolloneÍ¢‘„‘Žs cooking dips into Korean cuisine with crunchy charred octopus in gochujang the fermented chile paste. But before you file it under Asian fusion be aware that the one thing you must do at Piora is eat some pasta which can have complex deeply layered flavors. Bunna Cafe ,Brooklyn,Bushwick,This vegan Ethiopian lunch counter takes up residence at a fried chicken joint four days a week. The chef Kedija Srage who grew up in Addis Ababa has a gift for textural counterpoint juxtaposing berbere-spiked lentils with bright crisp kale. Food is scooped up with pieces of injera a spongy tangy Ethiopian bread. Thick fruit purÍ—‘©es come in glasses and coffee is made in an elaborate ceremony that includes carrying a smoking pan of roasting coffee beans to each table for everyone to breathe in. Kurumazushi ,New York,Midtown East,Hidden on the second floor of an intensely Ben Katchoresque office building filled with gem dealers Kurumazushi is one of New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs oldest sushi restaurants. At times the fish can approach transcendence: king crab from Canada very sweet squid made tender by a fine lattice of crosshatched cuts; gleaming amberjack and horse mackerel. But an omakase meal that starts at $300 should offer more than glimpses of euphoria.. KurumazushiÍ¢‘„‘Žs greatest asset is Toshihiro Uezu the chef. An antic grinning presence in front of a wall that looks like a Japanese sand garden Mr. Uezu has as much fun as anyone in the restaurant. Sushi Dojo,New York,East Village,High-sheen poppy neo-disco sets the tone; the sommelier who pours out two generous samples when you ask for a sake suggestion reinforces it. But the soul of the party is sushi worth getting crazy about. The chefs have a strong traditional bent and access to a wide variety of excellent seafood including seasonal specialties like needlefish and rarities like live octopus.Gastronomia Culinaria,New York,Upper West Side,Gastronomia Culinaria feels true to a certain type of small Roman trattoria where the food is plain-spoken and the pricing temperate. The chef and owner Vincenzo Pezzilli is a native of Rome who came to New York in 1997 at age 27 and has worked his way through many of the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs upscale Italian restaurants. A happy evening here could consist entirely of wine from the accessible list and antipasti polished but still immediate in their pleasures. Pasta made fresh in-house daily is sometimes overcooked sometimes wonderful. But the classic desserts Í¢‘„‘î panna cotta tiramisÍ—‘_ Í¢‘„‘î you can rely on. Quality Italian,New York,Midtown,"The owner likes us to do things tableside\u201d says a server as he assembles steak sauce on a trolley. Í¢‘„‘ñItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a little kitschy but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs fun.\u201d This would make a reasonably accurate motto for Quality Italian itself. A kind of clone of Quality Meats a block away with some Italian-American food grafted on for good measure it is the restaurant that finally answers the question Í¢‘„‘ñWhat if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?\u201d There are gimmicks galore but the food is so uneven you might as well place your order by spinning a roulette wheel. 
Crazy Crab 888,Queens,Flushing,Crazy Crab 888 is a former bodega turned Burmese-Yunnanese-Malaysian-Thai restaurant and aspiring Cajun crab shack. Dishes on the menu labeled Burmese or Yunnanese still rare sightings in New York excite; boiled seafood available by the pound does not. Order carefully and your meal could be spectacular.
Hearth,New York,East Village,When he opened Hearth in 2003 Marco Canora its chef and with Paul Grieco its owner set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. As fads came and went. Hearth diligently looked the other way. The same potato gnocchi wallowing in a wading pool of melted butter that he served at the outset will be on every second table tonight. Everybody else will get the same rich but not filthy-rich polenta although the ground corn is now grown in upstate New York not South Carolina. Mr. Canora gets few points for the originality of his vision but for his fidelity to it his score is off the charts. 
Le Restaurant,New York,TriBeCa,The bad news first: Le Restaurant is located in a basement. Its sole offering is a $100 tasting menu that is not posted in advance. Substitutions are not allowed. And the name is impossible to say with a straight face. Now the good news. The basement under a food market in TriBeCa called All Good Things is a cozy place. The blond furniture the pair of white candles suspended from a long row of wooden coat pegs and the smell of wood smoke all transport you out of the city to some other place Í¢‘„‘î maybe a soothing if somber cabin by a Swedish lake. And if you are an omnivore  who dreams about uncommon ingredients and pure focused flavors then Ryan TateÍ¢‘„‘Žs tasting menus are absolutely worth it. 
Shalom Japan,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Shalom JapanÍ¢‘„‘Žs unlikely name makes a merry hash of the cultural heritages of the married owners and chefs Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi. But their food is not so much a fusion of culinary traditions as a mapping of resonances and sympathies: edamame tossed in schmaltz; challah made with sake lees; a blintz of mochi-wrapped ice cream atop macerated plums and adzuki beans.
Khe-Yo,New York,TriBeCa,Khe-Yo tentatively introduces New Yorkers to the food of Laos which has been largely missing from the city. The restaurant is a collaboration between the chef Marc Forgione and Soulayphet Schwader one of his longtime cooks who was born in Laos and moved to Kansas with his family when he was 3 years old. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs easy to navigate his menu broken into appetizers and main courses that are heavy on animal protein. But while much of the food is very appealing not all of it makes you feel as if youÍ¢‘„‘Žve left home.
Umami Burger,New York,Greenwich Village,According to Umami BurgerÍ¢‘„‘Žs scrappy back story the owner Adam Fleischman a frustrated screenwriter with no professional culinary training devised the burger recipe in his home kitchen in Los Angeles in a single day. The result is a good occasionally exceptional burger which for all the umami bluster isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt notably different from other good burgers around town.
Whiskey Soda Lounge NY,Brooklyn,Lower East Side,Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai highlight reels while waiting for a table at Pok Pok Ny down the street. It is more than that though. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs also a  gallery of ThailandÍ¢‘„‘Žs bar snacks. Few items except for maybe the Vietnamese-style wings are substantial enough to be main courses. Still you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt a going-out-to-dinner kind of night but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers. 
Papa's Kitchen,Queens,Woodside,At PapaÍ¢‘„‘Žs Kitchen Beth Roa co-owner waitress and M.C. makes the rounds of tables gently proffering a karaoke microphone while in the kitchen her brother Miguel cooks serious Filipino comfort food. (Ms. Roa pitches in at the stove as needed.) The scent of roasted pork steals through the tiny room infiltrating clothes and hair. The menu is minimalist and mostly in Tagalog. Best to leave it up to the Roas and order the salu-salo sa bilao a feast of stupefying proportions presented in two winnowing baskets lined with banana leaves. 

Kura,New York,East Village,At the sushi counter at Kura Norihiro Ishizuka stands alone with a benevolent and slightly rakish air white-grey hair peeking out of the bottom of his cap. No glass cases separate him from diners; instead fish is heaped unceremoniously in a wide shallow basket. Mr. Ishizuka hefts the fish up and slaps it back down as if assembling sushi were a purely practical matter not requiring a soundtrack by Philip Glass. He works the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand making sushi with substantial cuts of fish tricky to eat in a single bite but beautifully fresh.
Lake Pavilion,Queens,Flushing,Lake Pavilion is almost certainly New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner shimmering above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. The main dining room always looks as if a wedding were about to take place but most of the celebrating Í¢‘„‘î birthdays and such Í¢‘„‘î goes on in private rooms where the karaoke action can get heated. For the rest of us finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. The kitchen is serious about the Cantonese classics along with a few more recent notions from Hong Kong. 
Distilled,New York,TriBeCa,The mission statement that preceded one of my meals at Distilled (Í¢‘„‘ñWe are an American public house\u201d) was slightly coy about the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs ambitions. Yes there are wings onion rings and ribs but they are elevated by unexpected spices and technical flourishes like a tousle of dehydrated and shaved bacon on a B.L.T. The space is blandly handsome with dark woods and breathless ceilings. Service is remarkably friendly Í¢‘„‘î hosts leap to open doors Í¢‘„‘î but the drinks are lady-killers elegant with a knife twist.
Estela,New York,Nolita,You know whatÍ¢‘„‘Žs coming within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room. You know that there will be a speech on how the menu works that most of the dishes will be small that sharing will be encouraged that the noise level will climb steeply that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. What takes you by surprise though is Ignacio MattosÍ¢‘„‘Žs cooking. The food is almost familiar but not quite and itÍ¢‘„‘Žs the little differences that get under your skin. Ingredients that donÍ¢‘„‘Žt seem to have been tampered with often have an unexpected depth of flavor. The food has a mild case of strangeness that draws attention to how deep and elemental the flavors are. 
Armani Ristorante Fifth Avenue, New York,Midtown East,Armani Ristorante on the third floor of the Armani store on Fifth Avenue looks a little odd. It is reached by a private elevator from the street or better a sinuous white ramp that twists past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. Tiny blue and purple lights twinkle in the windows; white circular booths with black leather tops look like an Armani twist on the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World. But when the menu is at its best it takes its cues from the understated style of Milanese cuisine. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish has precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese shows up you just sit there smiling because you can tell from the gorgeous amber crust how much fun you are going to have eating it. The prices are stunningly expensive but they are in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt as refined. 
Glasserie,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,GlasserieÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef Sara Kramer who spent time in the Marlow &amp; Sons empire diverges from the New Brooklyn model by reaching back to the Levantine spices of her Israeli heritage to create dishes that are at once artful and effortless. The restaurant at the northernmost tip of the Brooklyn waterfront is high-ceilinged but warrenlike with seating areas that feel like separate rooms and what may be the eeriest outdoor space in the city a terrace overlooking a dim cobblestoned internal courtyard Í¢‘„‘î essentially a back alley through which every now and then a motorcycle roars.
Taste of Persia NYC,New York,Flatiron,At Taste of Persia NYC a takeout counter tucked into a utilitarian pizzeria on 18th Street Saeed Pourkay serves his justly fabled ash reshteh a wondrous wintry outrageously thick Persian soup along with rustic stews that have been simmered for hours sometimes days. The food invokes the ancient splendors of the Spice Route but comes in ordinary plastic bins; forks and napkins must be foraged from the (very accommodating) pizzeria workers. In the back is a dining room with glaring fluorescents should you care to eat in.

Betony,New York,Midtown,Bryce Shuman the chef of Betony worked under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park for six years and traces of Mr. HummÍ¢‘„‘Žs style show up in his cooking. The refinement and focus are similar and so is the way that the signs of hard work have been tucked out of sight. BetonyÍ¢‘„‘Žs food has been fussed over but it isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt fussy. Mr. Schuman works with familiar flavors (roasted chicken; dry-aged short ribs; lobster with dill) but he gives them a clarity that can take you by surprise. The pleasure of his cooking isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt exactly discovery. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs more like rediscovery. 
Take Root,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,Take Root on a drowsy block by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is an improbable enterprise. Three nights a week it turns into a restaurant with seats for 12 diners serving multi-course un-ascetic remarkable meals. The staff is comprised of a couple co-owners Elise Kornack the chef and Anna Hieronimus the host waitress and busser. But if the setup is homey the food is not. Ms. Kornack who was a sous chef at Aquavit cooks with skill ardor and imagination offering seasonally attuned dishes with a quiet questioning intelligence.
Los Tacos No. 1, New York,Chelsea,Hatched by three entrepreneurial gents from the West (two from California one from northern Mexico) Los Tacos No. 1 is more or less engineered to serve as an oasis for all those West Coast transplants who are constantly complaining about the dubious quality of tacos in New York City. Bright and friendly the stand looks like a red white and black burger stand that you might have found alongside the Pacific Coast Highway circa 1955. The menu is limited but thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs how it should be. Deftly marinated and sliced from a flaming spit (imagine Mexican shawarma) the Tijuana-style adobada pork is the showpiece here. Get some of it inside a couple of hand-made corn tortillas and maybe a little more crammed into a quesadilla that has been dunked in hot oil. Help yourself to the sides Í¢‘„‘îÍ_‘_raw radishes charred green onions Í¢‘„‘îÍ_‘_and donÍ¢‘„‘Žt scrimp on the salsa.
The Pines,Brooklyn,Gowanus,The Pines looks like an indie band sounds: dark moody a little uncomfortable cobbled together in a hurry and brimming with allusions. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky faded bunches of dried flowers and herbs hang upside down over the bar evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin in the woods being used for Wiccan rituals. Angelo Romano's cooking can be peculiar at times too and the menu changes so frequently it's hard to know just what you'll get. But Mr. Romano's originality and discerning eye for ingredients reward extra patience.
Tres Carnes,New York,Flatiron,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs an alluringly simple idea: Take some Lone Star-quality barbecue (courtesy of a pitmaster who trained at the Salt Lick in Driftwood Tex. not far outside Austin) and put it into tacos and burritos. YouÍ¢‘„‘Žll encounter an abundance of sides and fillings as you make your way down the Chipotle-style assembly line: two kinds of rice two kinds of beans roasted corn chipotle squash pickled onions guacamole. TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre all fine. But be disciplined and resist the urge to turn your tacos into Trapper Keepers of glop. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs up to you to let the smoke of the meat come through without too much interference especially when you opt for one of the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs funky weekly specials which might involve pork belly or beef cheeks or roasted lamb. Taco stands rarely draw any olÍ—‘©s when it comes to dessert but the churro doughnut puffed around a sticky core of Mexican caramel qualifies here as a secret weapon.
Costata,New York,SoHo,Michael White returns to the address in SoHo where he made his name when it was called Fiamma. Now he is an owner and the restaurant is a steakhouse but in a nod to old times FiammaÍ¢‘„‘Žs garganelli with truffle cream is on the menu along with other dishes that show his mastery of fresh pasta. As at Marea his seafood palace on Central Park South there is a crudo section most of it very appealing. The steaks and chops are hit or miss but the veal chop is everything youÍ¢‘„‘Žd want from that cut and the bone-in rib-eye for two called the Costata is a reason for this restaurant to exist all by itself. 
Oda House,New York,East Village,Oda House on a subdued corner of Alphabet City may be the first restaurant in Manhattan to capture the inclusive and at times shambolic spirit of Georgian restaurants in southern Brooklyn. Seats are filled with vast families young women dressed in black from shoulder to mid-thigh and older women who occasionally lean over to the young womenÍ¢‘„ ‘Žs tables to dispense advice. The chef Maia Acquaviva was a plastic surgeon in Georgia before coming to New York and redirecting her knife skills. Her dishes draw on the vivid herbs and spices that characterize cooking along the former Silk Road in Central Asia including Georgian saffron otherwise known as marigold poised irresolutely between bitter and sweet; tarragon believed to have been originally uprooted from Siberia and brought west by the Golden Horde; and utskho suneli the dried seeds of blue fenugreek used as a spice almost nowhere else in the world. Variations on khachapuri the legendary Georgian flatbread with guts of melted cheese are too salty too cheesy and spectacular.
MP Taverna Astoria,Queens,Steinway,MP Taverna offers Michael PsilakisÍ¢‘„‘Žs second-generation melting-pot vision of an America where Greek flavors have been woven into the fabric of American cooking so thoroughly that theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre taken for granted. In this America nobody is surprised when a Í¢‘„‘ñroasted lemon chicken\u201d with satisfyingly crisp skin is sauced with rich avgolemono and threads of fresh dill. Dense white cubes of feta pickled in wood barrels are widely recognized as an appetizer that can hold its own with burrata. Tender gigantes are a natural addition to mussels neatly arranged in a skillet. And cooks who rely on the salty porky charms of sausage are apt to round out a dish with caul-wrapped sheftalia a favorite in Cyprus or loukaniko made at MP Taverna with leeks and orange peel.
Spice Symphony,New York,Kips Bay,Spice Symphony specializes in a subset of Indian cooking Í¢‘„‘î traceable back to KolkataÍ¢‘„‘Žs Chinatown and hugely popular across the subcontinent Í¢‘„‘î that gleefully appropriates Chinese flavors to strange and often wondrous ends. Where American Chinese food tends to the sweet and vapid with all the interesting bits buffed out Indian Chinese is hotter and more motley playing up the cuisinesÍ¢‘„‘Ž differences rather than seeking common ground. This is a shift in style for the chef Walter DÍ¢‘„‘ŽRozario who took a more elevated approach in his previous post as chef de cuisine at Junoon. There Mr. Rozario might have bundled spices into a bouquet garni to be neatly disposed of before plating; at Spice Symphony he throws in whole spices for a more rustic texture. (Í¢‘„‘ñThis is grandmotherly cooking\u201d he explained.) There are elegant renditions of classic Indian dishes as well and a thoughtful selection of wines by the glass; now if only the front of the house didnÍ¢‘„‘Žt fall to pieces in the face of crowds.
ABC Cocina,New York,Flatiron,The menu a collaboration of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Dan Kluger rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in Europe (that would be Spain) Central America and South America (although you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt need to go to Argentina these days to find chimichurri). This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones.
Feast,New York,East Village,The concept behind Feast is to find the midpoint between the ever more esoteric tasting menus that have proliferated around town and the humble satisfactions of a smorgasbord. Accordingly there are three Í¢‘„‘ñfeasts\u201d each consisting of eight dishes (plus dessert) revolving around a particular group of ingredients Í¢‘„‘ ñIron Chef\u201d-style delivered not in stately progression but four at once on plates set at the center of the table like a private buffet. These gently priced prix fixes can seem generous if you choose a good one and a bit of a grift if not. The chef Chris Meenan was chef de cuisine at Veritas and his background in haute American cooking asserts itself in small elevating details. But at times it seems that he canÍ¢‘„‘Žt decide whether dishes should be precisely composed or sprawl. The space itself is warm and inviting ideal for the large gatherings the restaurant hopes to entice. If its rustic references are familiar Í¢‘„‘î barn pulleys repurposed as light fixtures tarnished mirrors dish towels subbing for napkins Í¢‘„‘î they still appeal.
Daniel,New York,Upper East Side,Daniel serves exquisitely sensitive profoundly seasonal fundamentally French cooking. The excellence of the ingredients and the kitchenÍ¢‘„‘Žs talent for unlocking all they have to offer can be startling although at times they can be embedded in elaborate multipart compositions that donÍ¢‘„‘Žt fully reward the attention they demanded. But the attention to detail is unparalleled as in the basket of gorgeous breads the cheese cart (one of the finest four-wheel vehicles in New York) the desserts and the warm madeleines which are revealed when a server pulls back the folds of a napkin as if they were petals on a rose. The service can be among the best in the city with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness but it is not always that way for everyone. 
Mamak House,Queens,Flushing,Malaysian restaurants in New York tend to favor Peranakan or Straits Chinese cuisine. Mamak House (pronounced Í¢‘„‘ñmama\u201d with a silent K) focuses on the cooking of the Mamak community Í¢‘„‘î Malaysians with Indian Muslim roots Í¢‘„‘î on the island of Penang. The chef Nani Yusof Hughie grew up in PenangÍ¢‘„‘Žs capital George Town and her heritage like that of the city is a braid of cultures: Tamil Punjabi Chinese Thai and Dutch. While the dishes on the menu may sound familiar in flavor they lean more toward India than China which means they are spicier and less sweet and a revelation. The dining room has an unfinished air with defunct tabletop grills and exhaust hoods left over from the Korean barbecue joint that previously occupied the space.
Cherry,New York,Chelsea,It is hard not to feel vexed at Cherry which promises so much and proves such a tease. The mostly Japanese intermittently French restaurant owned by Jonathan Morr (also behind BondSt) and Eugene Morimoto occupies a subterranean space in the Dream Downtown hotel in the meatpacking district. The room is very dark and very red the lamp shades crinkled like garters the walls sheathed in brocade. There are glimpses of what the chef Andy Choi previously at Le Cirque and MÍ—‘ PÍ—‘_che can do Í¢‘„‘î a delicate madai carpaccio rosy with umeboshi (pickled plum) and strewn with puffed-rice-cracker pearls; gyoza swollen with short rib and foie gras and dappled with sour cherries and a plum sake reduction Í¢‘„‘î but the kitchen is prone to excesses of salt and sweetness and the sushi suffers from that cardinal sin over-vinegary rice. There are consolations to be found in the deep sake list and the excellent desserts. The bill however is a cruel anticlimax.
Nightingale 9,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,Nightingale 9 is named after a defunct telephone exchange associated not with the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs neighborhood Carroll Gardens but with the boroughÍ¢‘„‘Žs farther-flung less gentrified southeastern quarter. So too the chef Robert Newton Í¢‘„‘î who was born in Arkansas and runs the Southern restaurant Seersucker a few doors down Í¢‘„‘î borrows flavors across a distance finding resonances between the cooking of Vietnam and that of his heritage. Certain dishes loyal to their origins astonish but elsewhere the hard work in the kitchen doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt quite pay off. Fortunately adjustments can be made with the condiments provided among them Bluegrass soy sauce micro-brewed in Kentucky; nuoc cham made with Red Boat fish sauce from Phu Quoc Island Vietnam; and an emphatic house-made hot sauce of raw bird chiles. More canteen than restaurant Nightingale 9 is an appealingly rough-at-the-edges place to be with concrete floors walls of skim-coated brick and paint-splotched metal chairs arranged around communal tables. Chopsticks rest on clothespins a homey notion that Mr. Newton picked up down South while numbers stenciled on the walls are a nod to the table numbers typically found in hole-in-the-wall pho shops. 
Uncle Boons,New York,Nolita,This dark woody half-underground Thai pub serves some of the freshest and most dynamic Thai flavors in the city. At one end of the bar by the entrance is a motorized ice bucket that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. At the other is a kitchen window showing off a rotisserie and a charcoal grill where baby octopus and blowfish tails sizzle and pop. Í¢‘„‘ñThai-style drinking food\u201d is the ostensible theme but there are deeply aromatic curries and home-style cooking too. The owners and chefs Ann Redding and her husband Matt Danzer met while working at Per Se and the service has more Keller-esque finesse than youÍ¢‘„‘Žd expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of Í¢‘„‘ñAnother Brick in the Wall\u201d and Í¢‘„‘ñHang on Sloopy.\u201d
Hunan Manor,New York,Murray Hill,Hunan food is often overshadowed by that of Sichuan perhaps because it traffics in unmitigated heat without the tempering sweetness or the pins and needles along the tongue that come with Sichuan cuisine. And while notable Sichuan restaurants are now strung through lower Midtown Manhattan like a ring of fire Hunan Manor just south of Grand Central Terminal remains a bit of an outlier. In a comradely way the menu includes a few Sichuan classics along with two pages of American Chinese food thoughtfully segregated up front the easier to skip over. Trust in any dish with the words Í¢‘„‘ñpreserved\u201d or Í¢‘„‘ñsour\u201d in its name like preserved beef nearly black and chewy as toffee scattered among yellow-white skins of once-green chile peppers that have been blanched and sun-dried until leached of color and sour string beans diced to the size of wedding bands and heaped with minced pork and funnels of red chile pepper. The restaurant is a family operation owned by Alan Li and his sister Diana Li (who also run Hunan House in Flushing Queens) and Nancy Xiao a cousin. All are natives of Hengyang city in Hunan province as is the chef Zhi Jun Long.
Lafayette,New York,NoHo,Lafayette is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery a cocktail bar an all-French wine list and a rotisserie where chickens slowly give up their melting fat to potatoes and onions roasting below. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts. As for the food there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone. 
Casa Enrique,Long Island City,Long Island City,Cosme Aguilar the chef of Casa Enrique was born in Chiapas the southernmost state in Mexico but has spent much of his professional life cooking French food. Here he brings polish to Mexican classics without tampering with their essence. One distinctively Chiapan dish pork ribs suffused with cinnamon allspice fruity guajillo chiles and a housemade pineapple vinegar left to ferment for three months makes you wish there were more offerings on the menu from this region underrepresented among New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs Mexican restaurants. But Mr. AguilarÍ¢‘„‘Žs upbringing took him across Mexico and his menu ranges accordingly. He approaches the food not as a scholar but as a native speaker. Elsewhere in town higher-profile chefs who came to Mexican food later in life are embracing it as their own; at Casa Enrique Mr. Aguilar is experiencing a kind of homecoming. 
Kajitsu,New York,Murray Hill,To express wonder that KajitsuÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef Ryota Ueshima can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour butter sugar and eggs. Kajitsu practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin-ryori that was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries over many centuries and when the Japanese have have been working on an idea for hundreds of years they tend to figure a few things out. But itÍ¢‘„‘Žs still possible to be surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima can coax out of meals that westerners would call vegan. 
Los Perros Locos,New York,Lower East Side,Los Perros Locos translates as mad dogs a fair description of the house specialty: hot dogs in the ornate Colombian style in which dog (all-beef chorizo or for an infinitesimal decrease in debauchery vegetarian) and bun (split-top like a lobster roll and sweet from KingÍ¢‘„‘Žs Hawaiian) are subsumed by an avalanche of toppings. More strictly Colombian dogs are offered at three tiers of escalating complexity alongside wilder improvisations such as the Pablo Escobar named after the notorious drug lord of MedellÍ—‘_n and mounded with an off-white snow that the menu identifies as perico Spanish slang for cocaine. (It proves to be merely Cotija cheese.) The disco font on the signage starts to make sense. This is nocturnal tired-wired food for when your defenses are down. You eat it the same way you dance to that vapid song of the summer horrified at yourself looking over your shoulder to make sure no oneÍ¢‘„‘Žs watching.
Montmartre ,New York,Chelsea,The pot au pho and other French-Asian fusion dishes at Montmartre often have more conviction than the straight-up French food of many other New York bistros. Seats in the two dining rooms (a tiny one downstairs a slightly less tiny one upstairs) are so close together that you can find yourself playing Twister with servers who are simply trying to clear your plate. But the place has energy. The walls are covered with photographs: some are rowdy some cooly elegant; many were shot in Paris and others in New York. The images donÍ¢‘„‘Žt seem to belong together but like the cooking they converse intercontinentally. 
Carbone,New York,Greenwich Village,At Carbone they donÍ¢‘„‘Žt ask if youÍ¢‘„‘Žve dined with them before. Even if you havenÍ¢‘„‘Žt the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt Italian. It is a fancy red-sauce joint as directed by Quentin Tarantino taking a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured a little embarrassing beneath the notice of serious people and bringing back its the punch-in-the-gut thrills. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy a lust for excess that can at times make you a little queasy and an instinct for sheer entertainment that can make a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest unimaginative drones.
Maison Premiere,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,When Maison Premiere first opened in Williamsburg it was an exercise in mood (louche) and epoch (French Quarter circa the 1890s). Primarily a bar it served little more than absinthe and oysters. This was enough; everyone wanted in. But apparently the owners Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka want to be loved for more than good looks. A proper kitchen has been built in the basement and the menu expanded under the chef Lisa Giffen. Her food is impressionistic best appreciated as a series of lovely fleeting moments rather than the sustained arc that typically constitutes a meal: sea scallop with rosy pickled rhubarb and a drift of shaved horseradish ice hot and cold at once; Spanish mackerel charred before being steeped in a citrus escabeche; turbot and clams basted in seaweed butter and immersed in a chowder afloat with impeccably round potato orbs. A practical note: do not attempt to enter between the hours of 4 and 7 p.m. when oysters are $1 each and the crowd restless. Later you will still wait but at least with hope. 
SakaMai,New York,Lower East Side,SakaMai is a Japanese restaurant filtered through an American consciousness respectful of tradition but not bound by it. The chef Takanori Akiyama is a native of Japan who has long incorporated Western elements in his cooking. Some dishes like dried and broiled skate wings still threaded with cartilage are excellent examples of izakaya food; others Í¢‘„‘î like sea urchin and sturgeon caviar layered over loose scrambled eggs simmered at low temperature in the French style Í¢‘„‘î aspire in their fragility and miniaturist proportions to the precision of kaiseki. SakaMai does not commit to one genre of Japanese cuisine. It is an inclusive place gentle on neophytes. The sake list is smart without being too scholarly a good counterpoint to the esoteric cocktails whih feature ingredients like wasanbon a Japanese sugar kneaded by hand and the scent of scorched cloves and cinnamon trapped in a snifter and released at the table. The dÍ—‘©cor is understated: sheer white curtains votives eroded brick. Tucked in the back is a semi-secret den complete with a fireplace and a kilim.
Salvation Taco,New York,Murray Hill,When a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes too few of the tacos at this jammed and noisy restaurant inside the Pod a new hotel in Murray Hill. The tortillas slightly bigger than an English muffin can be topped so mimimally and sauced so timidly that they are overwhelmed by the taste of masa. Those tiny portions can cool quickly too. The best way to get a taco at Salvation is to roll your own from a Í¢‘„‘ñfamily-style feast\u201d impressive platters of protein that come with a covered basket of warm and fragrant tortillas.
Taqueria Tlaxcalli,The Bronx,Parkchester,The exterior with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long eventful night tells you to move on. The interior with mango-colored walls lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights tells you to stay. The menu includes tacos tortas gorditas sopes and molcajetes all prepared with fidelity to the spirit of Mexico CityÍ¢‘„‘Žs taquerias.
Bunker,Ridgewood Queens,Ridgewood,This scuffed yellow storefront with a floral-plaid ruffle in the window across from a 24-hou"Caravaggio,Manhattan,Upper East Side,Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic whose sadistic power to stand in the way of a good time is second only to that of the chastity belt. The tables are draped with linens ceiling baffles keep the noise to a low burble and streamlined chocolate-leather chairs offer a quaint amenity known as lumbar support.The plates are just as carefully put together assembled with a sharp eye for color and form. But the cooking for all CaravaggioÍ¢‘„‘Žs civility is haunted by inconsistency. Giovanni Rana Pastificio &amp; Cucina,Manhattan,Chelsea,Half a century ago in a village outside Verona Giovanni Rana the son of a baker started making tortellini by hand and delivering it to customers from a hamper on the back of his Guzzino motorbike. Today the company he founded sells frozen fresh pasta around the world with global revenues of $500 million. His namesake restaurant at Chelsea Market formally announces RanaÍ¢‘„‘Žs arrival on our shores. Alas few of the pastas fulfill the promise of the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name and small-town-boy-makes-good history. The standout dishes are the secondi Í¢‘„‘î suckling pig with great crackle or saddle of lamb still crimson at the center Í¢‘„‘î and the flagrantly appealing desserts like the fried dark chocolate ravioli which is best eaten with the fingers. The space is an expanse of scarred wood floor and exposed brick with dangling copper pots (handmade by artisans in Italy) and checkered ravioli rolling pins giant cheese graters (from Italian flea markets) mounted above the bar and artful black-and-white photographs of Mr. Rana smiling through clouds of flour. Mr. RanaÍ¢‘„‘Žs red Guzzino is rigged up in one corner hamper and all; in another stands a vintage crimson-wheeled pasta machine resembling a movie projector which Mr. Rana helped design in the 1960s. An evening here is a kind of dance between distrust of the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs theme-park theatrics and grudging acknowledgment of your primal response to them.Prospect,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,The desserts at Prospect are neither afterthoughts nor tangents. As conceived by Annika Loureiro the pastry chef they are an extension and possibly the fullest realization of the themes and intent of the preceding meal: landscapes of half-dehydrated grapes inside frosted shells and drifts of white chocolate powder or a dark chocolate cremeux perfumed with Cynar a bitter artichoke-based liqueur and topped with a chocolate cookie rippled like a flag caught midflap. (They are also as it happens delicious.) That Prospect even has a pastry chef Í¢‘„‘î a rare sighting these days at small Brooklyn restaurants where chefs constrained by budget or space try to muddle through on their own Í¢‘„‘î signals the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs ambition. Kyle McClelland the executive chef and an owner and Vinson Petrillo the chef de cuisine construct not so much dishes as culinary terraria in which beauty occasionally outranks flavor. The main courses tend to be more obvious and less exciting so perhaps the wisest way to approach Prospect is to bypass the regular menu for the more focused five-course tasting.Salt &amp; Fat,Queens,Sunnyside,Daniel Yi the chef and owner of Salt &amp; Fat was born in Seoul grew up in Sunnyside and its eastern neighbor Woodside Í¢‘„‘î both home to sizable Asian communities Í¢‘„‘î and honed his craft at Riingo and Sapa where the accents were respectively Japanese and Vietnamese. He describes his cooking as New American and in a sense it is exactly exultingly that Í¢‘„‘î the food of the new America in which immigrants companionably raid one anotherÍ¢‘„‘Žs larders. I would call it more precisely Asian American which should not be confused with fusion. Here exotic ingredients arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt being co-opted and sublimated; theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre not thought of as exotic in the first place. If you grow up eating hot dogs with rice and pizza with kimchi why not introduce sambal to meatballs pair a classic French duck breast with lychees and steep oxtail in dashi before compressing it into a wondrous terrine?Malai Marke,Manhattan,East Village,From the outside Malai Marke could be just another vaguely dubious restaurant on the twinkle-lit East Sixth Street of a decade ago before that Curry Row stronghold of bedspread-bedecked Indian restaurants gave way to purveyors of macrobiotic Japanese bento boxes and high-end tequila. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name (pronounced Muh-LYE Mar-KAY) means literally with cream as used when ordering tea but as slang itÍ¢‘„‘Žs looser more suggestive signifying general oomph: extra spicy rich sweet. Nevertheless the food here is remarkably subtle each dish tasting wholly distinct. The finest offerings declare their provenance from IndiaÍ¢‘„‘Žs southwest Konkan and Malabar coasts. Shiva Natarajan the chef and owner has a sheaf of Indian establishments in the city including Chola in Midtown and Dhaba in Murray Hill but makes his way to the kitchen at Malai Marke almost daily. Randazzo's Clam Bar,Brooklyn,Sheepshead Bay,The dark concentrated oregano-accented tomato sauce ladled on hot or chilled lobster fried shrimp steamed mussels scungilli or fried calamari is so central to RandazzoÍ¢‘„‘Žs mission that some customers never look beyond it. But East Coast classics like steamers clam chowder and raw shellfish are worthwhile; so is a lot of the Italian-American cooking even though the pasta is the kind that restaurants in the United States used to serve before the term al dente got its green card. Customers come in all shapes sizes colors and ages drawn by prices that are not intimidating especially for fresh seafood; by the heartfelt welcome at the door; and by the neon lobster that you can see from the other side of Sheepshead Bay.The Library at the Public,New York,East Village,It is an axiom that restaurants attached to entertainment venues are an afterthought; like roadside motels they appeal to necessity not desire. But there is nothing glib about the food at The Library at the Public a crepuscular attic of a restaurant chiseled from the upper recesses of the lobby at the Public Theater. The brief menu is a collaboration between Michael Oliver and his longtime mentor Andrew Carmellini who oversees Locanda Verde (where Mr. Oliver was chef) and the Dutch. The pleasures here are cumulative the sum of small quiet gestures; the mission is ecumenical to please not provoke. This ends at the bar where very strong drinks come with dark footnotes. The name and dÍ—‘©cor of the restaurant pay homage to the buildingÍ¢‘„‘Žs original incarnation as the Astor Library established in 1854. Once a haven for Í¢‘„‘ñgrimy unwashed literarians\u201d it now counts among its patrons Í¢‘„‘î enthroned on tufted banquettes and in high-backed chocolate leather chairs Í¢‘„‘î older couples taking a break from the Carlyle whole bespectacled clans and the occasional thicket of young women with loose drapes of hair and dresses the size of flags. Xixa,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,At Xixa which opened in December in South Williamsburg Mexico is merely a starting point for a kind of culinary free association that can be borderline loco or brilliant sometimes both at once. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name is pseudo-Mayan pronounced shiksa as in the Yiddish word for a non-Jewish woman Í¢‘„‘î a label good-naturedly embraced by Heather Heuser who runs Xixa with her Jewish boyfriend Jason Marcus the chef.Hanjan,New York,Midtown South,Hooni Kim has quickly become New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs leading interpreter of Korean cuisine. Like his slightly older restaurant Danji Hanjan has a menu divided between traditional dishes (a squid-and-scallion pancake) and new ideas (slices of raw wild salmon that you wrap around salad greens in a spicy sesame dressing). And once again the cover versions and the original compositions are so much in touch with the spirit of Korean cooking that it can be hard to tell which is which.La Vie en Szechuan,New York,Midtown South,The sidewalk board is scrawled in Chinese but you are far from Chinatown on 33rd Street under the needle of the Empire State. You do not expect to find past the glass storefront and the yolk-colored banner gestures toward elegance. But inside the walls are mounted with minutely carved hardwood fans and shutters; asymmetrical serving bowls land on white tablecloths; and in the evenings the plain paper napkins of lunch are swapped for ones printed with a single pink rose. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name La Vie en Szechuan is less a nod to Edith Piaf than a worldly sounding pitch to the moneyed Chinese who have been coming to New York. Along with this comes less oil in the cooking and more decorative presentations. The marvel is that the chef Zhong Qing Wang a native of Chengdu manages to refine Sichuan classics without extinguishing them. It is easy to make a fetish of Sichuan cuisineÍ¢‘„‘Žs numbing heat but Mr. Wang understands that what is more interesting are the gradations and the timing of the detonations. The language of servers and diners alike is Mandarin. But even if you speak it Í¢‘„‘î or are in fact Chinese Í¢‘„‘î the servers will steer you away from particular dishes. Do not be offended: they know what they are doing. Crave Fishbar,New York,Midtown East,Crave FishbarÍ¢‘„‘Žs handsome and urbane dining room hardly looks adventurous with its becalmed nautical dÍ—‘©cor: round mirrors suggesting portholes gray planks of wormy wood vertical ropes and banquettes sheathed in yacht-club plaid. Then comes the wink. The Art Deco wallpaper pattern turns out close up to be ghostly tentacles and gold crinkled orbs of jellyfish Í¢‘„‘î a pattern named after the captain of the Titanic. The shipwreck theme has resonance: in 2008 the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs previous incarnation Crave Ceviche Bar shuttered after suffering damage in a crane collapse. Four years later the owners (including Todd Mitgang the chef) opened Crave Fishbar directly across the avenue from the original location. This time around the brief is broader. There are glimmers of the unexpected like the use of nori powder black garlic burnt lemon peel and schmaltz and an earnest and effective lobster curry. At times the place has the feel of an upscale canteen with something for everyone: cavatelli an exemplary vinegar-fried chicken leg braised short rib Í¢‘„‘î the last for as a waiter bluntly put it Í¢‘„‘ñmen.\u201d But something more interesting lurks in the depths.The Dining Room at the Modern,New York,Midtown East,Of Danny MeyerÍ¢‘„‘Žs two restaurants on the ground floor of the Museum of Modern Art the casual Bar Room is more fun but the Dining Room has the view of the sculpture garden and a dining experience that goes from one delight to another. The chef Gabriel Kreuther prepares dishes that are more elaborate than the relatively rustic ones in the Bar Room but the complications pay off in rewarding layers of harmony and contrast; he makes his ingredients do what he wants them to do while still tasting like themselves. Marc AumontÍ¢‘„‘Žs classically inspired desserts and his shock-and-awe mignardise cart virtually guarantee that the meal will end on a very high note.Chez Sardine,Manhattan,West Village,Gabriel Stulman an increasingly busy restaurateur has described Chez Sardine as Í¢‘„‘ña very inauthentic take on a Japanese izakaya.\u201d This is the kind of izakaya where a bite-size piece of hamachi sushi is crunchy with fried pork rinds and where sashimi is slipped in among a stack of flapjacks. The chef Mr. Stulman installed is Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly who spent his formative years at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal. That restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs fat-on-fat school of cooking comes through in a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with foie gras garnished with cucumbers pickled in rice-wine vinegar. Sometimes at Chez Sardine this kind of excess succeeds and sometimes it is just too much. Jeepney,New York,East Village,Dinner at Jeepney which describes itself as a Filipino gastropub can feel like parachuting into Manila. You wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt know all the vocabulary and you might not always know what you are putting into your mouth but you know youÍ¢‘„‘Žve left home. Every so often the severs cry Í¢‘„‘ñba-luuuuuuut!\u201d as a duck egg with a two- to three-week-old embryo inside leaves the kitchen. On Thursdays Jeepney puts away plates and silverware and serves kamayan dinners on banana leaves; guests roll up their sleeves and get down to business. There are things for the less adventurous too like adobo chicken wings and an intensenly garlicky rice porridge called arroz caldo. But Jeepney is best suited for people who see dinner as a chance for exploration; it may be less so for those would blush at the nipples on the back roomÍ¢‘„‘Žs photomurals one set belonging to the first Filipina to appear in Playboy the other to the first in German Playboy. Mayfield,Brooklyn,Crown Heights,Mayfield is broadly American in mission with an occasional Southern twang. The restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs name is a hat tip to Curtis Mayfield the soul singer songwriter and civil rights advocate. To aspire to soul is at once laudable and hazardous. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a welcome surprise that the chef Lev Gewirtzman gets so much right starting with the earthy flawless collards spoon bread with the body of a soufflÍ—‘© and the heart of a pudding and buttermilk-fried quail like a Southern Christmas breakfast. The dining room is deep and dim with amber bars of light along the exposed-brick walls keeping most of the illumination to themselves. Everything takes on a sepia tinge. Somehow this feels uncontrived. You almost believe that the battered wooden folding chairs Í¢‘„‘î pews from a Kentucky church Í¢‘„‘î were purchased out of necessity not aesthetics.Pig and Khao,New York,Lower East Side,Before opening Pig and Khao Leah Cohen the chef spent a year eating and cooking in countries like Vietnam Thailand and the Philippines where her mother was raised. Eating at the restaurant can be like poring over an album of carefully edited postcards from her travels. The menu leans heavily on buzz words like Í¢‘„‘ñcrispy\u201d instead of less familiar Asian vocabulary but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to care because Ms. Cohen has such a talent for bright clear flavors. Nearly every dish has enough salt acidity and crunch to satisfy the most curmudgeonly judge on Top Chef where she first came to national attention. Mighty Quinn's Barbeque,New York,East Village,Mighty QuinnÍ¢‘„‘Žs which slow-cooks high-quality meats using only wood comes as close to delivering on all fronts as any barbecue place in the city. The pulled pork is the only one in town that doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt make you embarrassed for New York. The inside meat is slick with the flavor of old-school pork butt tender enough that carvers in heavy black gloves can grab it by the fistful and shake it into dripping hunks. Spare ribs are exceptional too meaty and juicy with a smoky outer ring the color of cherry soda. The beef rib is an instant conversation stopper a long block of impressively tender meat clinging to a Jurassic curve of bone. The brisket shows as much finesse as anything youÍ¢‘„‘Žre likely to eat from a cardboard tray. Even the sides the awfulness of which is almost a point of pride at some Southern barbecue joints are excellent especially the burnt-end baked beans.The Marrow,New York,West Village,The two trunks of Harold DieterleÍ¢‘„‘Žs family tree are stamped on his menu: Famiglia Chiarelli on the left with the polenta and the fettucine; on the right with sauerkraut and schnitzel Familie Dieterle. But another invisible line divides the menu too. It is the split between dishes that are completely sure of their purpose and the ones so overembellished itÍ¢‘„‘Žs unclear what the idea was meant to be. Luckily many aspects of The Marrow are in sharp focus. Ginger FisherÍ¢‘„‘Žs dessert lineup goes from one pleasure to another and the wine list assembled by Jill Roberts is a thrill particularly if you prize the incandescent energy and clarity of Austrian and German whites.Barraca,New York,West Village,JesÍ—‘_s NÍ—‘_Í—‘±ez a native of Spain who ran two notable restaurants in Madrid first appeared on the New York dining scene two years ago at the high-end Graffit (later renamed Gastroarte) where he disguised cauliflower purÍ—‘©e as an egg and squid-ink-blackened falafel as truffles in pulverized-olive Í¢‘„‘ñdirt.\u201d At Barraca his casual new tapas spot in the West Village what you see is what you get: small overheated volcanoes of piquillo peppers brimming with oxtail say or a munificent heaping of duck confit on crisp flatbread with an underlay of apple roasted to a pliant mellow sweetness. For the most part the food is straightforwardly delicious although some dishes do not bear too much scrutiny and are best enjoyed as tapas should be with a glass of Rioja in one hand and a not entirely clear head.Lao Dong Bei,Queens,Flushing,It is best to come to Lao Dong Bei with a friend who speaks Mandarin or a crib sheet or at the least humility and an open mind. The restaurant specializes in the cuisine of the Dongbei region of northeast China (formerly known as Manchuria) which is still relatively new to our shores and hasnÍ¢‘„‘Žt yet entered into a dialogue with or succumbed to the American palate. The chef An Hong Li is a native of Harbin the famously frozen capital of Heilongjiang province which borders Inner Mongolia and Siberia. He and his wife Zhu Wen Xia live in a building behind the restaurant and at times it feels as if the dining room is an extension of their home as Ms. Zhu efficiently carves ribs ladles soup into bowls and and dashes out to buy plastic forks for chopstick-shy children. You would require an army to exhaust the menu which includes a rack of lamb ribs crackling with cumin; a stew in which chicken after long canoodling with dried mushrooms takes on their intensely earthy flavor; and a version of sweet-and-sour pork that in its subtlety bears no resemblance to the American-Chinese dish you may have known heretofore.Maysville,Manhattan,Midtown South,MaysvilleÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef Kyle Knall and owner Sean Josephs have built a restaurant that feels thoroughly American. The cheese plate showcases domestic products as does the wine list and the cache of more than 100 whiskies. Servers are outfitted in plaid shirts and blue jeans as if trying out for a remake of Í¢‘„‘ñThe Dukes of Hazzard.\u201d This can feel a bit hokey but Maysville is a confident restatement of the American tavern and a smart pushback against the invasion of gastropubs. The common theme on the menu is smoke turning up in country ham hay-roasted oysters and smoked trout.Han Joo,Manhattan,East Village,On a crystal slab lie scarlet ribbons of meat with a bridal trim of fat hissing and collapsing. Gone is the thunderhead of smoke you expect at a Korean barbecue joint the constant scraping of the hot plate the burnt debris. Han Joo offers barbecue by way of the spa each tabletop grill an infrared sauna in miniature the pulse of heat from the crystal cooking everything to eerie evenness. You miss the drama but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to argue with results: the meat is tender retrieved from the grill moments before dissolution. Han Joo is an offshoot of a restaurant in Flushing Queens whose specialty alongside barbecue is naeng myun a summer dish of lissome noodles in an ice-cold beef broth. In winter you may shore up the immune system with potent soups and stews poured over rice. Other dishes are upstaged by banchan the small plates that come unbidden with every meal and wind up colonizing the entire surface of the table.Lakruwana,Staten Island,Stapleton,Of the half-dozen or so Sri Lankan restaurants on Staten Island Lakruwana is far and away the most spectacularly designed. The dining room with stone-covered walls punctuated by painted shutters and a door resembles a small house turned inside out. All around the room are painted masks sharp pairs of spears statues of the Buddha and other items that sailed to New York from Sri Lanka. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a showcase for the nationÍ¢‘„‘Žs arts and crafts and the menu is a showcase for its distinctive often spicy cuisine. Lakruwana may be New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs most elaborate realization of the immigrant restaurateurÍ¢‘„‘Žs dream: a shrine to another culture that can soothe homesickness in some patrons and kindle a thrilling sense of discovery in others.Krescendo,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,It is unclear why KrescendoÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef Elizabeth Falkner and its owner Nancy Puglisi camouflaged the place so thoroughly but it is much better than the neighborhood Italian joint it is trying to pass for. Pizzas made in a Neapolitan oven covered in copper and bronze tiles vary from classic marinaras and magheritas to the Finocchio Flower Power an essay on the theme of fennel. The quality of a restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs pizza often correlates negatively with that of its pastas and salads but Ms. Falkner brings the same quiet focus to all her cooking at Krescendo.Tanoshi,New York,Upper East Side,Tanoshi is a surprise in a city with few options for sushi between the wincingly expensive and the suspiciously cheap. Its storefront is cluttered with plants a ceramic happy cat and an enormous white light fixture that calls to mind an exploded chrysanthemum. Taped near the door is a page-long manifesto from the chef Toshio Oguma which gently Í¢‘„‘ñencourages\u201d diners to eat his sushi with their fingers and refrain from dunking it in soy sauce. (Heed him.) Mr. Oguma worked at Morimoto here and in Napa County Calif. where he was executive sushi chef. At Tanoshi he has stripped things down. The restaurant has only 10 seats and only sushi is on offer served omakase (chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs choice) which includes 10 pieces of nigiri and two rolls and never comes to more than $50. This is sushi in the classical mode with the kind of attention to detail you expect to find at New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs high temples of sushi not a sushi bar with a neon Í¢‘„‘ñOpen\u201d sign in the window.Arlington Club,New York,Upper East Side,A self-described steakhouse that can be experienced in any number of ways. The beef is classic steakhouse meat: corn-fed Midwestern prime-grade dry aged and seared on a 1200-degree broiler. Yet some of the best things on the menu are not the ones youÍ¢‘„‘Žd see in a traditional steakhouse like popovers truffled gnocchi mac and cheese or a defiantly French crÍ—‘Îpe soufflÍ—‘© for dessert. Laurent Tourondel the chef has an almost diabolical knack for sophisticated crowd pleasers. When heÍ¢‘„‘Žs in the zone as he is most of the time at Arlington Club his cooking is as ingratiating as it is skillful; it wins your affection right away and then earns your respect.Zizi Limona,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Zizi Limona which opened in Williamsburg in September cultivates an air of unhurry. As for the name: it is happy nonsense invented by the owners veterans of Middle Eastern establishments in Manhattan who wanted to be free of culinary or geographic limitation. Zizi Limona could be Israeli or Italian a grandmother squeezing lemons on a sun-swamped veranda a memory to keep you going through the winter. The chef Nir Mesika 29 grew up in Israel but his mother was born in Casablanca and his recipes borrow from her Shabbat dinner table and reach across the Mediterranean. Some renditions are more faithful than others.El Toro Blanco,New York,West Village,Once you plow through the crowds struggling in vain to catch a bartenderÍ¢‘„‘Žs eye at El Toro Blanco you emerge into a dining room that might be in Santa Barbara during the last days of the Nixon administration. This hip retro design is the latest sign that in New York City Mexican cuisine is cool of the moment and ready to be presented without the quotation marks. Admittedly the interior makes the point more forcefully than its menu. The main courses are on the mild side and the sauces rarely achieve the profound interplay of heat bitterness smoke fruits nuts and spices that can make Mexican cuisine so rewarding. Balancing that though is the kitchenÍ¢‘„‘Žs emphasis on fresh flavors and its appealing lineup of street snacks and other appetizersMurrayÍ¢‘„‘Žs Cheese Bar,New York,West Village,MurrayÍ¢‘„‘Žs Cheese Bar stands a few doors down from its mothership the venerable and encyclopedic MurrayÍ¢‘„‘Žs Cheese Shop. Its titular attraction comes in two forms the perennial dichotomy of raw and cooked. On one side of the menu are permutations of melt bake and fry including deep-fried curds given a Buffalo-style baptism by fire and fondues poured over hapless burgers that never knew what hit them. But the heart of the restaurant lies in the roster of cheeses culled from Murray's voluminous archives and caves beneath Bleecker Street. You may choose a precomposed cheese flight but why when you can ask the cheesemonger on duty to improvise? This is cheese omakase a parade of rarefied specimens laid out on a slate board with compatriots and unexpected condiments (pickled kimchi wasabi-pea brittle) Í¢‘„‘î a gluttonous meditation.Aamanns-Copenhagen,New York,TriBeCa,The New York foothold of a popular Danish modern sandwich shop serving expensive artisanal smorrebrod (open-face sandwiches) on excellent Nordic bread in a lofty white space in TriBeCa. Bistro SK,Bronx,City Island,In a remote nautical enclave of the Bronx where the restaurants are best known for fried clams and views of Long Island Sound Bistro SK is an improbably authentic and intimate French bistro. Go for the professional service and expertly turned out classics like snails in garlic butter mussels in white wine and cream steak au poivre and floating island. LÍ¢‘„‘ŽApicio,New York,East Village,The polenta dishes along with most of the pastas and appetizers are handled so expertly that it almost doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt matter that LÍ¢‘„‘ŽApicioÍ¢‘„‘Žs grasp of the main courses is much less steady. After eating from the opening sections of the Italianesque menu you can be in such high spirits that you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt necessarily mind when the uncharismatic pork chop or dubious Arctic char shows up. You can even forgo them altogether. Uneven in ways that would be fatal for another restaurant LÍ¢‘„‘ŽApicio can deliver a very enjoyable night out if you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt ask too much of it.Barclays Center,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,Barclays CenterÍ¢‘„‘Žs spaceship-shiny silver lobby is lined with with 12 permanent concessions that all make some claim to a Brooklyn bond. Among the old-timers are NathanÍ¢‘„‘Žs the Coney Island hot-dog stand and L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens the venerable Bensonhurst pizzeria. Here too is the new Brooklyn bearded and ironic dedicated to the handmade and the small batch. Artisanal sausages from the Michelin-starred chef Saul BoltonÍ¢‘„‘Žs Brooklyn Bangers are sold alongside NathanÍ¢‘„‘Žs dogs; Blue Marble organic soft-serve made with cream from pasture-raised cows is studded with shards of cakes and cookies from JuniorÍ¢‘„‘Žs. Keep in mind that all Barclays food operations are partnerships between individual vendors and Levy Restaurants which runs similar arena concessions across the country so not everything has a homemade touch. No matter. At night with the drooping chorus of Í¢‘„‘ñBroook-lyn Broook-lyn\u201d Í¢‘„‘î half hip-hop half Gregorian chant Í¢‘„‘î throbbing faintly from the arenaÍ¢‘„‘Žs core mournful and triumphant at once old and new Brooklyn become one.Royal Seafood Restaurant,Manhattan,Chinatown,We go to Chinatown restaurants because no part of Manhattan so readily offers better food for less money; because the portions are truly meant for sharing; because even those places that donÍ¢‘„‘Žt change their fluorescent bulbs as often as they might still buy fresh snow pea shoots each day. Royal Seafood has glinting chandeliers not fluorescent bulbs but its suits all the other criteria beautifully. It has the added benefit of serving food that is often very close to Cantonese cuisine the original flavor of Chinatown with enough modern Hong Kong flourishes to let you know that itÍ¢‘„‘Žs 2012.La Tarte FlambÍ—‘©e,Yorkville,Upper East Side,La Tarte FlambÍ—‘©e aspires to the spirit of a traditional Alsatian winstub or tavern minus the checkered tablecloths. The dish that lends the restaurant its name is a handkerchief of dough with a crisp fringe and slightly wilting interior rolled out so thin you wonder how it holds itself together. It comes in a rough rectangle on a wooden pallet a meld of nubbled bread crÍ—‘Îme fraÍ—‘Œche caramelized onion and lardons in craggy pink clusters. A slice has almost no weight at all and then it hits you: smoke tang a slash of flagrant sweetness. In the dialect of Alsace this distant cousin to pizza is known as flammekueche; to La Tarte FlambÍ—‘©eÍ¢‘„‘Žs young Alsatian owner Mathias Peter it is simply Í¢‘„‘ñflammy.\u201d The location of the restaurant in Yorkville on the Upper East Side is fitting given the dishÍ¢‘„‘Žs Franco-Germanic origins: a century ago the neighborhood was the hub of German immigrant life in the city.Moti Mahal Delux,New York,Upper East Side,Heavily influenced by the Persian cuisine that was brought to the subcontinent by the Mogul emperors the cooking of North India still has an imperial lavishness when cooked with care and consideration for ingredients as it is at Moti Mahal Delux. The restaurant is itself an outpost of an empire a chain centered in New Delhi that has built a formidable reputation among Indians for its tandoori chicken butter chicken and that black-lentil dal.Dirt Candy,New York,East Village,Since opening in the East Village in 2008 the chef Amanda Cohen has been waging war on the Í¢‘„‘ñeat your vegetables\u201d mind-set. While all her dishes are vegetarian (and nearly all can be made vegan on request) Ms. Cohen isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt necessarily out to save a small planet or prevent heart disease. Her goals are possibly more subversive and she achieves them with vegetable cookery that is original clever visually arresting and above all a lot of fun.Ducks Eatery,New York,East Village,Exciting things are happening at Ducks Eatery where a bayou smokehouse meets a backpacker pipe dream. Shrimp heads are injected with ssamjang (a mixture of Korean fermented soybean and chile pastes) and dipped in liquid nitrogen before being tossed onto the grill and painted with whipped lardo; yakamein a kind of bootleg ramen indigenous to New Orleans is crossbred with Malaysian laksa to produce a 30-ingredient super-broth. At times you think youÍ¢‘„‘Žve stumbled on a low-rent Atera. But the fuss doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt always pay off. Flavors tend to pop one after another each obliterating the one before like a string of firecrackers. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs the seemingly straightforward dishes Í¢‘„‘î lettuce wraps of crispy pig ears impeccable ribs brined in fish sauce and shrimp paste Í¢‘„‘î that deliver the frankest pleasures. Will Horowitz the chef and an owner is committed to the cause: he recently moved into the apartment above the restaurant the better to watch over the smoker. M. Wells Dinette,Long Island City,Long Island City,This reprise of M. Wells which operated in a tin-can diner for just over a year is not open for dinner and seems to have scaled back the portions ever so slightly for daytime eating. But its chef Hugue Dufour did not return to the kitchen to make cucumber sandwiches. The menus which change daily can be read as methodical studies in the uses of animal fat. There are times when excess does not lead to success. Then again you might just accept the occasional greasy sauce as the price you pay for all the food at M. Wells Dinette that youÍ¢‘„‘Žll never find anywhere else least of all in a museum cafe. Rustic L.E.S.,New York,Lower East Side,Rustic L.E.S. is the name of this tiny restaurant in the far east of the Lower East Side and it looks it with faint stains of light from bare bulbs against exposed brick and concrete. Vintage wooden mandolines hang on a shadowy wall. Technically there are 19 seats but 5 are just stools at the bar; the rest are divided among a shifting configuration of tables. The woman who asks you gently mid-meal what you think of the food is Elsa Leon one of the owners. Her husband Yassir Raouli may stop by later on taking a break from his post in the kitchen and hold the door open for you when you leave. Three years ago the couple started Bistro Truck a food truck specializing in the cuisine of Mr. RaouliÍ¢‘„‘Žs native country Morocco with a tilt to the Mediterranean. Rustic L.E.S. which opened in September is their first culinary venture with a fixed address and a chance for Mr. Raouli a self-taught chef to try out more elaborate dishes like oxtails braised with preserved lemons and lamb meatball tagine. The food is uneven which is to say homey. But it has the imprint of someone who takes pleasure in cooking and in sharing that pleasure.Ganso,New York,Downtown Brooklyn,Ganso is half-hidden on a bland tangent off the Fulton Street Mall in Downtown Brooklyn at a midpoint between Armani Exchange and IHOP. The chef Ryuji Irie a native of Japan was second-in-command to Tadashi Ono at the now-shuttered Matsuri; one of the owners  Harris Salat is an American devotee of Japanese soul food who has co-written three Japanese cookbooks (two of which happen to be sitting on my kitchen shelf). The menu reads as a catalog of straightforward pleasures but the scrupulously pleated gyoza and kimchi-boosted pork buns surprise and the chicken wings are a feat of engineering the crust blistered and coppery the sauce a mere evanescence of sweetness. There is a tendency toward overdelicacy in seasoning however which extends to the ramen. While the noodles have tooth the broths are puzzlingly reticent. You detect layers of flavor complicated equations of alkalinity and suspended fat and yet and yet: they have nuance and dimension but no impact. Still they are so meticulously made you wonder for a moment if youÍ¢‘„‘Žre missing something. Some ramen broths detonate at first spoonful then fizzle out halfway through; others start off meek and turn carnal. Ganso aspires to the latter. After my initial disappointment I kept eating idly expecting nothing and as I dragged up broth from the bottom of the bowl the flavors began to deepen and assert themselves. What I had thought nebulous took on a distinct point of view. No MSG is used no artificial flavor boosters. And no condiments are on the table. There is an austerity to the proceedings a sense that something is being asked of us the diners as well. Patience perhaps.Guy's American Kitchen &amp; Bar,New York,Times Square Theatre District,On his show Í¢‘„‘ñDiners Drive-Ins and Dives\u201d Guy Fieri cruises around the country rasping out slangy odes to the unfancy places where Americans like to get down and greasy. He is televisionÍ¢‘„‘Žs answer to Calvin Trillin if Mr. Trillin bleached his hair drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles. But the kind of cooking he celebrates on television is treated with staggering disregard at his restaurant in Times Square. Even the nachos are unlovable. Gran ElÍ—‘©ctrica,Brooklyn,Fulton Ferry,Gran ElÍ—‘©ctrica an upscale Mexican restaurant near the Dumbo waterfront in Brooklyn wants to have it both ways: to be elevated yet rustic chic yet homey. For the most part it succeeds thanks to the chef Sam Richman who did stints at WD-50 and Jean-Georges. One of a number of non-Mexican chefs tackling Mexican cuisine Mr. Richman is closer in spirit to Rick Bayless than Alex Stupak seeking to honor tradition rather than riff on it. Presentations are blunt without embellishment but the flavors are hard-hitting and precise. And while the food is earnest and unshowy the drinks are glamour girls. Has there ever been a margarita as lovely as the one splashed with beet juice cardinal red ermined in salt with a wafer of beet stabbed through the heart and laid across the rim? It is barely sweet as it should be. There is a garden out back but in off-months indoors has its own cheeky charm with toile wallpaper populated by frolicking skeletons an homage to the 19th-century Mexican illustrator JosÍ—‘© Guadalupe Posada. In the dim light you can almost make out the details: fleshless horses loping around JaneÍ¢‘„‘Žs Carousel skeletons in beards and suspenders on vintage trikes cackling. But where are the young lovelies clutching their margaritas?CÍ—‘_modo,Manhattan,SoHo,Two years before opening CÍ—‘_modo the newlyweds Felipe Donnelly and Tamy Rofe began moonlighting from their day jobs as advertising executives by hosting weekly dinner parties in their TriBeCa apartment for carefully pre-Googled strangers. Twitter fame and a cease-and-desist letter from the New York City health department followed; they rethought their lives; and CÍ—‘_modo on the western fringe of SoHo is the result. It is almost a clichÍ—‘© of a romantic restaurant: white curtains wafting out into the half-deserted street light catching on stemless wine glasses a blur of candles against dark wood. Mr. Donnelly who is of Colombian descent has lived in Spain Brazil and Mexico and his menu rambles with dishes like the BogotÍ—‘ specialty ajiaco (for which soup is too humble a term) cranberry-studded lamb burgers tucked into Brazilian pÍ—‘£o de quiejo (think gougÍ—‘Îres) and ceviche strewn with cancha an Andean popcorn that swaps fluffiness for crunch. The restaurant feels pleasingly improvised belonging to more languorous clime where supper doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt start until 10 p.m.. and evening is one never-finished conversation.Talde,Brooklyn,Park Slope,A veteran of Vong in Chicago and Buddakan in New York before his time on Í¢‘„‘ñTop Chef\u201d Dale Talde has a well-polished knack for translating Asian dishes for popular tastes. He has reimagined the Vietnamese dish cha ca la Vong for instance as a do-it-yourself fish taco. Compared with the soaring theatrics of Buddakan Talde is spartan a long white rectangle enlivened here and there by elaborate 19th-century mahogany carvings of Orientalist motifs like elephants and dragons'21' Club,New York,Midtown,There are only a few things at Í¢‘„‘ñ21\u201d that one can order with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash the Í¢‘„‘ñ21\u201d burger and the coconut cake topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut. But to judge Í¢‘„‘ñ21\u201d as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like GalatoireÍ¢‘„‘Žs in New Orleans Í¢‘„‘ñ21\u201d is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling but: Í¢‘„‘ñCan I get you something to drink?\u201d On a good night everybody who works at Í¢‘„‘ñ21\u201d behaves like a bartender and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. Blue Collar,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Blue Collar is a sunny counter-service-only spot with red chairs and round white tables anchored by bottles of ketchup and mustard and vintage National Safety Council posters (DonÍ¢‘„‘Žt Ride on a Moving Rig! Keep Aisles Clear!) clamped to clipboards zig-zagging along the wall. Burgers built in the In-N-Out Californian style start at $4 single and unadorned and top out at $6.25 for a double with cheese which is the one you want. The thin 3.5-oz. patties are pressed down with weights on a flat-top grill so they get a nice dark crust but hold their juices. The potato bun is appropriately squishy the toppings (lettuce tomato onion pickles secret sauce) uncontroversial. Without cheese it is nothing. With cheese Í¢‘„‘î plain American of course Í¢‘„‘î it is a contender. It may lack the precision engineering of Shake ShackÍ¢‘„‘Žs but it satisfies nonetheless.Lake Trout,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Lake TroutÍ¢‘„‘Žs name refers to a working-class Baltimore specialty that is neither lake in origin nor trout. It consists of whiting a salt-water bottom-feeder deep fried and flung on white bread. The chef and co-owner Matt Lang a Baltimore native thoroughly debones the whiting fillets Í¢‘„‘î contrary to tradition: crunching a few bones is supposed to be part of the fun Í¢‘„‘î before coating them in cracker meal and flour. They are paired with a thick sweet-ish potato bread that is yellow as pound cake and malleable as Primaloft. The fish nubbled copper with ashy wrinkled undersides curl desperately in on themselves and taste as if they never knew salt. Another cheap Baltimore standby the cheese fish Í¢‘„‘ñsangwich\u201d as it is spelled on the menu is a square of deep-fried Alaskan pollock that arrives half disintegrating into a mush of tartar sauce and a concoction of Velveeta pickled jalapeÍ—‘±os beer cayenne and garlic powder. The space is cheerless hemmed in by dark wood panelling from the seventies that no one wishes back with Baltimore sports memorabilia on the walls evoking a teenage boyÍ¢‘„‘Žs abandoned bedroom.Pok Pok Phat Thai,New York,Lower East Side,You can go so long without eating good pad Thai that you forget what it is supposed to taste like. So the version at Pok Pok Phat Thai on the Lower East Side is confusing at first. The noodles are loose lustrous but not slick. The flavors are balanced subtle almost too much so. You must retrain your tongue to recognize them: sour tamarind; briny fish sauce; sweet-salty nubs of preserved radish; raw peppery blades of garlic chives; chile just tickling. Palm sugar mellower than cane sugar is barely detectable. Some might call this bland. Keep digging. It takes a few bites for the sense of wonder Í¢‘„‘î and gratitude Í¢‘„‘î to kick in. The chef is Andy Ricker who tends a small flock of renowned Thai eating and drinking spots in Portland Ore. along with a Brooklyn outpost Pok Pok Ny. Note that pad Thai is not available at Mr. RickerÍ¢‘„‘Žs other establishments. He has resisted serving it until now partly to evangelize on behalf of more obscure Thai dishes and partly because in Thailand the best pad Thai is made on the street by specialists one portion at a time. Here in a half-sunken space below Rivington Street papered in vintage Thai record sleeves everything is made to order and served still smoking cooking and commingling on a banana leaf laid over a paper plate. It is perhaps as close as you can get in this town to the real thing.Phayul ,Queens,Jackson Heights,At Phayul whose name means fatherland in Tibetan the food is lively and rugged true to what you might find in the alpine villages of Kham and on the austere steppe of Amdo regions that straddle eastern Tibet and western Sichuan. Those expecting mildness and calm may be shocked when a slow paralysis takes hold of the tongue. The cause is emma better known as Sichuan peppercorn a spice found on the Tibetan plateau and omnipresent here. On the walls are black-and-white photographs of Lhasa as it was before 1959 when the Chinese military occupied Tibet; by the cash register are handouts from the Tibet Action Institute with tips for increasing online security. Gently moderating the scene is the Dalai Lama beaming down from a framed photograph on a shelf lined with offering bowls filled with candy. Yunnan Kitchen,New York,Lower East Side,A sleek package of glass and exposed brick on an unreconstructed block of the Lower East Side Yunnan Kitchen takes a farmerÍ¢‘„‘Žs market approach to the cuisine of Yunnan Province. Few New Yorkers know much about this food which enables Travis Post the chef and Erika Chou the owner to take some liberties without getting pulled over by the authenticity police. Mr. PostÍ¢‘„‘Žs fresh locavore sensibility leads to takes on Yunnanese cuisine that are straightforward and uncomplicated. In one key way this is a liability: nothing at Yunnan Kitchen builds to a pitch of flavor that makes you dream about your next visit. That may change as Mr. Post explores a bit more deeply; in the meantime there are enough lovely tastes to build a good meal. Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya,New York,Lower East Side,The strains of empire are apparent at Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya the latest addition to Eric and Bruce BrombergÍ¢‘„‘Žs ever-expanding Blue Ribbon portfolio. The restaurant ensconced on the second floor of the Thompson LES Hotel rises above Orchard Street but cannot be said to overlook it: the wall of windows has been blacked out with rough vertical planks. This is meant to evoke the coziness of a subterranean izakaya or Japanese pub but the mood is more brooding lounge. Diners slump in half-moon booths attempting to spin the lazy susan secreted in each glossy tabletop or hunch on plush tuffets around communal tables sneaking peeks at the neighbors. The cluttered menu spans four pages plus a sheet of specials. It helps to be eating with an entourage. The loveliest dishes are the smallest and the most traditionally Japanese. But the sushi tends in style more to party platter than jewel box and the Blue Ribbon classics Í¢‘„‘î fried chicken bread pudding Í¢‘„‘î disappoint.Ichimura at Brushstroke,New York,TriBeCa,Ichimura at Brushstroke does not go out of its way to advertise itself. There is no sign on the street and no door of its own; you enter it through Brushstroke. One explanation for the low profile is that tiny hard-to-spot restaurants are a longstanding tradition in Japan and Ichimura at Brushstroke is steeped in tradition. Its chef Eiji Ichimura practices the Edo-mae style of sushi that he learned decades ago in Tokyo. Developed in the 19th century before refrigeration Edo-mae sushi was made with fish that had often been cured in salt or vinegar or stored in soy sauce to keep it from spoiling. While Mr. Ichimura has toned down his use of salt over the years his fish still offers stronger flavors than are encountered in most New York sushi restaurants. Even the rice seasoned with a blend of three vinegars is unusually assertive; it may ruin other sushi for you. Bobwhite Lunch &amp; Supper Counter,Manhattan,East Village,Southern fried chicken is the mission at Bobwhite Lunch &amp; Supper Counter a small no-fuss storefront in Alphabet City whose owner and chef Keedick Coulter hails from Roanoke Va. First the chicken is baptized in sweet tea and left to brine overnight; then it is dredged in milk flour salt pepper and mystery spices that Mr. Coulter refuses to divulge. Into the pressure fryer it goes then onto your plate the skin dark bronze and nubbly the flesh tender and salty-sweet. It comes as a complete supper (available all day) with an overgrown buttermilk biscuit mottled gold on top and devastatingly moist inside and a dutiful salad. Side dishes are less successful with the happy exception of the pork-heavy Brunswick stew. Prices are gratifyingly low given Mr. CoulterÍ¢‘„‘Žs commitment to using only free-range birds and grass-fed heritage pork. And although the space is not particularly cozy people linger.Le Cirque,New York,Midtown East,After nearly four decades Sirio Maccioni still greets each table at Le Cirque flattering loyal customers and pretending to recognize new ones. The tone of a restaurant is set at the top and in this one the formal old-fashioned way of tending to a table is softened by a warmth that feels genuine and a pride in doing things properly that can never be faked. Le Cirque practices a style of service that many people now regard as stiff and fussy. They wouldnÍ¢‘„‘Žt say that if theyÍ¢‘„‘Žd seen the servers at Le Cirque in action. Over decades on the job they have learned their movements and courtesies down in their bones.AmÍ—‘li,New York,Upper East Side,AmÍ—‘li was once Persephone a haute Greek restaurant in the stoic Upper East Side mode. Now the food is more expansively Mediterranean and the space is detailed in steel and reclaimed pine with minimalist lamps made by local artisans and menus fastened to wooden boards with metal strips. New too is a commitment to seasonality and sustainability. The fish are line-caught by a Montauk fisherman; humanely raised grass-fed steers are butchered in-house. For dessert cannoli is drizzled with honey that may have come from a rooftop or balcony near you. The chef Nilton Borges Jr. a native of Rio de Janeiro previously did stints at Diner and Colicchio &amp; Sons farm-to-table stalwarts. His dishes at their best are assertive but unmannered true to their ingredients. The daring wine list curated by James Mallios a co-owner of the restaurant is hundreds of bottles deep with numerous choices from the land of Dionysus.Lulu &amp; Po,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,On a residential corner of Fort Greene a brisk 10 minutes from the nearest subway and two ill-lighted blocks north of the restaurants clustered on DeKalb Avenue Lulu &amp; Po feels hidden. Even people who live in the neighborhood might never stumble upon it. This is too bad because it is a nice place to spend a drifty evening sipping a Moscow Mule with muddled ginger crunching deep-fried anchovies stung with a sriracha tartar sauce and eating a not-so-humble chicken with shatteringly crisp skin. Lulu &amp; PoÍ¢‘„‘Žs pleasures are modest and familiar: grown-up drinks rustic snacks and sound seasonal ingredients approached without too much deference. The space is a neat square thankfully underfurnished and styled in that industrial-cozy chic that Brooklyn does so well. The chef Matthew Hamilton previously at Prune and Belcourt named the restaurant after his daughter Lucy and his wife Po Kutchins. On a busier corner it would be sure to find an audience. It deserves one.Nougatine at Jean Georges,Manhattan,Upper West Side,Though it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Vongerichten restaurants Nougatine has been one of the most dependable year in and year out. Established 15 years ago as the easy-going bistro next door to the demure elegance of Jean Georges it is Audrey Tautou to the flagshipÍ¢‘„‘Žs Catherine Deneuve. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a livelier more kinetic space than Jean Georges; thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a long mail-slot window into the kitchen where you can see the cooks in their whites silent and purposeful. (Hey thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs Jean-Georges Vongerichten at the pass!) Despite the night-on-the-town gloss the soul of the menu is not far removed from what you might cook at home Í¢‘„‘î or to be more realistic about it what Mr. Vongerichten might cook if he had you over to his apartment. Ni Japanese Delicacies,New York,Lower East Side,In the depths of the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side past the cheesemonger the Latin grocer and the baklava shop stands Ni Japanese Delicacies a cluttered stall without tables or chairs. In the crowded glass case are small plastic bins of exquisite dishes that are only partly Japanese such as octopus cured in yuzu and pitched into chewy sweet hominy and smoked mackerel from Russ &amp; Daughters tucked into a sushi roll . For the owner and chef Atsushi Numata a native of Tokyo who has lived in New York for the past 22 years local sourcing means wandering the neighborhood. This is improvisation not fusion: the classic New York story. Rosemary's ,Manhattan,West Village,There are reasons RosemaryÍ¢‘„‘Žs waiting list has been oversubscribed since its opening. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario BataliÍ¢‘„‘Žs finishing school. You can spot some of the headmasterÍ¢‘„‘Žs knack for energetic flavors in RosemaryÍ¢‘„‘Žs linguine tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles or in a chilled shrimp antipasto with mint jalapeno and ginger. Most of the prices offer remarkable values given the quality. The same isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt always true of the wine list which has 40 bottles all priced at $40 many with higher-than-usual markups.La Vara,Brooklyn,Cobble Hill,The newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef Eder Montero who also own Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan. With La Vara they are exploring new territory the vast legacy of the Jews and Arabs who shared the Iberian Peninsula with Christians for centuries. The imprint of this three-way mixed marriage on SpainÍ¢‘„‘Žs cuisine isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt always evident. La Vara urges and rewards a closer inspection.Biang!,Flushing Queens,Flushing,Biang! is a collaboration between David Shi and his son Jason Wang both natives of the ancient imperial city of XiÍ¢‘„‘Žan in central China. The recipes drawn from that cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs street vendors and casual noodle shops are Mr. ShiÍ¢‘„‘Žs; the design which takes more than a few pointers from places like the Momofuku restaurants is Mr. WangÍ¢‘„‘Žs. The merged sensibilities result in a place where Chinese grandparents can sit down next to young people who may not know the original recipes but can recognize great flavors and a very good deal when they see them. Brooklyn Crab,Red Hook Brooklyn,Red Hook,A block from the Red Hook waterfront stands Brooklyn Crab a shanty writ large three stories high and already looking faintly dilapidated although it was built this past year. The dÍ—‘©cor if such a word applies involves giant gaping fiberglass fish lobster traps and twinkle lights. Out back are rustic bean-bag-toss stations and a bare-bones miniature golf course. The bottom level is essentially a holding pen where people wait sometimes for hours for a proper meal on one of the upper levels. (Drinks and limited food are available perhaps to prevent an uprising.) By the time your name is finally called it is too late. The seafood -- mostly fried and steamed -- is just all right. Grey Lady,New York,Lower East Side,The mood is blithe at Grey Lady whose name salutes befogged Nantucket where the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs owners summered when young. Loiterers at the long marble-topped bar have the air of preppy surfers who will be fox-hunting come fall. This is the seafood shack by way of Ralph Lauren: grainy sunlight through floor-to-ceiling windows pale beach-glass bottles matrices of mismatched mirrors and black-and-white photographs burlap pillows askew on a dusty blue leather couch. It harks back to the kind of New England seaside resort that has no locks on the doors and little recreation beyond adultery and highballs. With this atmosphere the food does not have to be good but it is particularly the lobster roll -- which is also available next door at the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs takeout counter Downeast Clam Shack minus a little meat and the beautiful crowd. Fisherman's Dawta,Boerum Hill Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,At this languidly cluttered Jamaican spot the walls are that blue somewhere between sea shallow and untroubled sky. Reef-print banquettes are encased in plastic a piece of driftwood pins magazines to a battered wood coffee table and Í¢‘„‘ñRedemption Song\u201d is on the speakers. Behind the counter Jennefier Ewers the owner and chef takes orders and cooks squeezing bottles and jostling pans sometimes singing along with Bob Marley. Do not expect speed. Settle out back where stone steps lead to an archetypal oasis of weathered planks leafy trees and turquoise umbrellas. Time expands. All will come including jerk chicken whose coy sweetness gives way to blindsiding heat. This is how Scotch bonnet peppers attack: one detonation after another like a string of firecrackers. Nicoletta,New York,East Village,NicolettaÍ¢‘„‘Žs pizzas are not quite deep dish but they are heading in that direction. The crust is as strong as epoxy and are piled up with an abundance of toppings that would buckle an ordinary pie. In thickness and heft a Nicoletta pizza resembles the September issue of Vogue.Foragers City Table,New York,Chelsea,Foragers City Table which opened in April is an annex to the boutique market Foragers City Grocer. Both are offshoots of Foragers Market in Dumbo Brooklyn which subscribes to the credo of local sourcing and sustainability. The owners run a 28-acre farm in the Hudson Valley that provides the stores and the restaurant with eggs herbs and vegetables some grown some foraged. The menu cadges seasonings from across Asia deploying to sometimes stunning effect Burmese fermented tea leaves Japense yuzu koshu and Vietnamese nuoc mam (fish sauce). The dining room an airy box of polished wood and steel beams is handsome if slightly unspecific -- what might happen if West Elm opened a restaurant. You wish it had more dirt under the fingernails. The adjoining grocery is cozier a lovely place to stroll after dinner stocking up on Whimsy &amp; Spice cookies and blessing all the artisanal vendors in Brooklyn.Reynard,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Nearly everything that comes out of ReynardÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen is chosen by hand and cooked with firewood. The chef Sean Rembold has a farmer who will pick baby okra pods when theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre the size of a AAA battery. He has a fishmonger who can deliver bluefish yanked from the sea so recently it can be served ceviche-style with smoked crÍ—‘Îme frÍ—‘¢iche. Most of the dishes bear the stamp of a grill or a woodburning oven. ReynardÍ¢‘„‘Žs hoods must be powered by jet engines because you donÍ¢‘„‘Žt smell smoke at your table until you get close to your food. Then you canÍ¢‘„‘Žt miss it. Mexicocina,Mott Haven the Bronx,North New York,At this small cheerful storefront in the South Bronx tacos on coarse handmade corn tortillas could take most of their Manhattan rivals in a fight. But it is the daily specials that demand the trek uptown. Mexicocina which opened in 2008 is one of the more formal Mexican joints in these parts which is to say there are a few tables at the back past the takeout counter with its glass vats of horchata and tamarindo. The owner and chef Antonio Vilchis writes courtly thank-you notes to Yelp reviewers asking for ways to improve. Pull up a seat by the brick oven where an electric log flickers and you will soon find your shoulders vibrating to loud Mexican pop. Plate upon plate is delivered more than you thought you asked for. It is food you might be served in a Mexican friendÍ¢‘„‘Žs home on terra-cotta dishes much like these dotted with sunflowers. It is food that makes you feel loved.Atera,New York,TriBeCa,Seasonal cooking in New York has often meant a narrow devotion to simplicity. In the open kitchen behind the counter of this intimate tasting room Matthew Lightner is chasing another path a cuisine that foraged ingredients together with technical sleight of hand to summon up moments of genuine beauty. At times he seems to be feeling his way toward  a highly articulated poetic response to the seasons  that is something like a modern Western version of kaiseki. It doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt all hang together but so much of it does that a night at Atera is one of the most fascinating experiences you can have in a New York City restaurant.Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine,New York,Midtown West,It is Godzilla in chinchilla this debonair beast of a restaurant that presides over the far West Side sprawling the length of a city block. Marvin Gaye and the Brothers Johnson are on the soundtrack leopard spots and cowhide on the walls. This is Clyde FrazierÍ¢‘„‘Žs Wine and Dine a cult of personality built around Walt Frazier known as Clyde a notorious sartorialist and National Basketball Association Hall of Famer now a Knicks color commentator with a penchant for effervescent Seussian rhymes. At the restaurant Mr. Frazier is ubiquitous in the streetside scrim of photographic murals from his mutton chop days on the court; in the towering portraits wrapped around pillars calling to mind the statues at the temples of Karnak; and often in the flesh posing and cozying at each table. The main dining room is a relatively subdued haven of dove-gray chairs and white tablecloths. A concrete ramp takes you  past the bar shimmering with some three dozen flat-screen TVs to the lounge where tucked behind a pillar is perhaps the most magical architectural feature of any restaurant in the city: a jewel-box half-basketball court paneled in oak and encased in glass for playing horse between appetizer and entree. Alas the menu has more in common with the Knicks of 2012 than of 1970: it lacks cohesion discipline and flair. Still everyone is having a good time: young black men in preppy swag; white men trying their best in earnest suits; elegant black women dressed up for no oneÍ¢‘„‘Žs pleasure but their own. Behind a pillar a hostess dances goofily by herself as if rehearsing for next June when the Knicks take it all the way.Almayass,New York,Flatiron,The Alexandrians an Armenian family based in Lebanon operate the original Almayass in Beirut along with its spinoffs in Kuwait Riyadh Abu Dhabi Qatar and now New York. All of them have Armenian-and-Lebanese menus shaped by the familyÍ¢‘„‘Žs history. The Alexandrians punch up Lebanese dishes with Armenian accents like lemony grains of crushed red sumac berries and flecks of Aleppo pepper that offer more robust flavor than fiery heat. The restaurant even stages a comeback for some Armenian classics that havenÍ¢‘„‘Žt been served in Manhattan in years. Family values set the tone for the whole experience of eating at Almayass. At times that is refreshing; occasionally like oneÍ¢‘„‘Žs own family it can drive you slightly bananas.Mile End Sandwich,New York,NoHo,Mile End Sandwich the Manhattan offshoot of Mile End deli in Brooklyn looks more like a Helmut Lang boutique than an appetizing shop. The roster of sandwiches more expansive than in Brooklyn reads like a family album of the Jewish diaspora. (The lineup of breads alone is an incantation: rye pumpernickel pletzel challah weck pita poppy onion zaÍ¢‘„‘Žatar.) The chopped liver is made with duck jus the smoked turkey sandwich layered with turkey rillettes. The brisket comes from pastured Angus cows. Inevitably the portions are smaller. Is it truly a deli if the sandwiches donÍ¢‘„‘Žt topple? Quibbling is part of the fun. A few blocks and a world away is KatzÍ¢‘„‘Žs the real thing since 1888. Surely there is room enough in this town for the prodigy and the maestro. Hill Country Barbecue Market,New York,Midtown South,This is a state-of-the-art Manhattan homage to the pre-industrial craft of Texas barbecue particularly as it is practiced in the town of Lockhart. The meat is not as deeply smoky but the crisp salt-and-pepper crust on the moist brisket and the beef and pork ribs does a lot to make up for it. The prime rib and beef shoulder are terrific slabs of roast beef medium rare through and through and the jalapeÍ—‘±o-cheese sausages shipped from Kreuz Market in Lockhart are insistently spicy. Atypically for a barbecue joint the sides and desserts are at least as good as the meat. Hot Kitchen,New York,East Village,The word Í¢‘„‘ñhot\u201d does not adequately convey the seemingly infinite shades of heat that ripple through this small unpretentious Sichuanese restaurant a minimalist canteen in whitewashed brick and red beams that is closer in geography and spirit to N.Y.U. than Chinatown. If you had world enough and time the 164-dish menu would be less frustrating. It helps to have a native speaker in your party. (At least this seems to spur the cooks to be more generous with those precious husks of Sichuan peppercorn the magic bullets of Sichuan cuisine.) Í¢‘„‘ñCold\u201d dishes are among the fiercest here deadlocks of fire and ice. In other plates a single ingredient Í¢‘„‘î like cumin so fragrant you canÍ¢‘„‘Žt tell if you are smelling or tasting it or the salty-sour spoor of pickled amaranth Í¢‘„‘î tips the balance toward revelation. Mandarin pop songs occasionally laced with bossa nova wobble from above. On every table it seems is a different dish. Come prepared to sit heart racing and sweat.Pok Pok Ny,Brooklyn,Columbia Street Waterfront District,Altered perceptions come free with the price of dinner at Pok Pok Ny opened by the chef Andy Ricker of Portland Ore. Mr. RickerÍ¢‘„‘Žs specialty is recreating the food of northern Thailand which has been hard to find in New York City. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs not as incendiary as the cuisine of other regions and makes great use of the grill; look around the backyard tent and youÍ¢‘„‘Žll see an extraordinary outdoor kitchen where charcoal smolders in a variety of devices. The warm breath of smoke turns up all over the menu as does a parade of little-seen Thai herbs and other ingredients. Unless you arrive very early the wait for a table can be measured in hours but apart from Mr. RickerÍ¢‘„‘Žs takeout wing shop on the Lower East Side there is nowhere else in town to get these flavors.Yopparai,New York,Lower East Side,To enter Yopparai you must climb the stoop of a Lower East Side tenement press a buzzer and wait in the foyer until a pocket door skids open and a figure in black behind a curtain of ropes beckons. But this modest sake bar isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt playing hard to get just making the best of its awkward perch in a repurposed railroad apartment. No password is required Í¢‘„‘î although a reservation helps as there are only 30 seats. And the people who work here seem genuinely happy to be found. The owners Gaku and Christy Shibata work the floor Mr. Shibata tending bar Ms. Shibata keeping guests from noticing how tight the space is. Everything is designed to unknot the mind: cushioned benches for two in lieu of bar stools; sake poured in doll-size cups forcing you to sip; comforting small plates and rustic snacks; a cloudy undertow of jazz. At Yopparai you eat the way you drink in tiny mouthfuls. And so the hours drift. You will not notice. Battersby,New York,Cobble Hill,Exposed-brick walls plank floors tables barely wide enough for a game of checkers Í¢‘„‘î you think you have heard this story before: the new Brooklyn! And then the food arrives and you are under a chandelier at Gramercy Tavern. Well almost. There are limits to what can be achieved in a closet of a kitchen by just three men: Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern who worked together at Alain Ducasse and Anella and chummily share executive-chef duties here and their sous-chef Michael Sowa. But at its best the food at Battersby is thoughtful poised occasionally revelatory. The menu of about a dozen dishes changes as often as three times a week. Best to submit to the five- or seven-course tasting which the chefs improvise on the spot for half what you might pay across the river. This is fine dining in hipsterÍ¢‘„‘Žs clothing: the new new Brooklyn.The NoMad,New York,NoMad,The NoMad is operated by the same duo who run Eleven Madison Park in New York and with a chance to do a second larger more populist restaurant inside the NoMad Hotel Daniel Humm and Will Guidara its ambitious young operators could have taken the well-traveled route with a bistro or trattoria. Instead they have done something rather novel and wonderful. The NoMad takes recipes developed in Mr. HummÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen at Eleven Madison Park and translates them into a more open and generous style. ABV Wine Bar ,New York,East Harlem,Childhood nostalgia machismo plus a dash of stick-it-to-the-man: this pretty much sums up the attitude behind ABV Wine Bar. ABVÍ¢‘„‘Žs take on comfort food that is less reinvention than merry spree artisanal ingredients and avant-garde technique in service of the munchies. This translates to the likes of foie-gras fluffernutters and beef-tartare pizza with the occasional emissary from another more rarefied restaurant like pickled veal tongue and charred strawberry sorbet. Diners pack 12 to a table on picnic-bench seats under menu boards with pushpin letters or grab metal stools along the soaring glass storefront. The mood is scrappy populist utterly unlike the Upper East Side. It is not quite a revolution but it could be. Hakkasan New York,New York,Clinton,This multimillion-dollar exercise in Orientalism off Times Square is the seventh in a global chain started in London. Some of the dim sum items including the steamed dumplings can be very good. But some of the main courses are about as interesting as a box of paper clips and everything is deliriously expensive. Catch,New York,West Village,Catch in the meatpacking district has a department storeÍ¢‘„‘Žs dimensions and a nightclubÍ¢‘„‘Žs twitchy heart. It begs the question: Can you eat well at a restaurant with 260 seats bored hostesses incoherent decor and a party-platter-friendly menu primed for franchising? Confoundingly yes. Much of the menu reads like a catalogue: you may order crab by the pound seafood by the tower oysters and Krug as a gift set and mix-and-match fishes and sauces. But there are glimmers of the chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs personality and some expert cooking of monstrous specimens of scallop and titanic whole fish beasts of the deep. Still the bill is a cold shower and when you leave no one meets your eye. You paid your fare you got your ride. They are already moving on to the next wave of high rollers to the next outpost in the works (hello South Beach). You canÍ¢‘„‘Žt help feeling slightly used. Neta,New York,Greenwich Village,One of the two chefs who founded Neta Nick Kim was head chef at Masa. His partner Jimmy Lau was head chef at Bar Masa where among other duties he was in charge of international fish buying. But sushi purists looking for hard-to-obtain Japanese seafood species are likely to be disappointed. Instead Neta has compensatory pleasures like the quality of its rice the exceptional vegetable sushi and above all the small plates like spicy salmon on a sizzling bed of rice or duck skin and foie gras in a thin dugout carved from a cucumber.. Brushed with the chefsÍ¢‘„‘Ž take on hoisin sauce it becomes Peking duck sushi. Back Forty West,New York,SoHo,For Back Forty West Peter Hoffman took the name of his East Village restaurant Back Forty and borrows many of its dishes. Unlike the original Back Forty West is open all day an agreeable corner cafe that pours coffee by 8 a.m. The neighborhood has embraced the restaurant giving the place a confidence and sparkle that take it well beyond the routine farm-to-table tropes. Bar Corvo,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,In 1998 Emiliano Coppa and Anna Klinger opened Al di LÍ—‘_ a Venetian trattoria on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope then a dodgy strip of boarded-up windows and five-and-dimes. Suddenly Manhattanites started crossing the Brooklyn Bridge for dinner. Fourteen years later the husband-and-wife team have put themselves in canary-in-the-coal-mine territory again opening Bar Corvo in Crown Heights. The menu reprises at a slight discount Al di LÍ—‘_Í¢‘„‘Žs greatest hits including the fabled malfatti naked (i.e. pasta-less) dumplings of ricotta and Swiss chard. Bar Corvo is sleeker than its shabby-chic older sister but less daring in the kitchen. It is not quite a destination restaurant just the restaurant everybody wants in their neighborhood. Anjappar,New York,Kips Bay,Chettinadu cuisine the specialty of this New York franchise of a Chennai-based chain with some two dozen outposts worldwide is surprisingly meat-centric considering its origins in vegetarian-dominated southern India. Ignore the extraneous North Indian dishes on the menu and take the road less traveled by. Previously difficult-to-find delicacies include a curry mobbed by whole garlic cloves with nary a vegetable in sight and stunningly hot braised goat which gains its heat not from piled-on chile peppers but from a complex orchestration of nearly every spice in the Indian larder.Le Bernardin,New York,Midtown,No other restaurant in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply when it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Under the relentless guidance of Eric Ripert the executive chef and Maguy LeCoze his partner in the business Le Bernardin moves forward without resting. After dining room redesign in 2011 the interior walks in step with the cuisine: up-to-date lively intimate and playful.Miss LilyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Bakeshop &amp; MelvinÍ¢‘„‘Žs Juice Box,New York,Greenwich Village,Miss LilyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Bake Shop &amp; MelvinÍ¢‘„‘Žs Juice Box is a cheerful spot thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs part diner part beachfront snack shack: a handful of tables some bar stools at a counter a pair of benches set outside under striped awnings. The star of the show is MelvinÍ¢‘„‘Žs Juice Box a juice bar where the drinks are more than just liquid multivitamins; theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre carefully constructed compositions with such intense and vivid flavors youÍ¢‘„‘Žll devour them just for the pleasure of how they taste. The Melvin is Melvin Major Jr. a veteran of the juice bar at Lifethyme the health food store in Greenwich Village: he might be New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs first celebrity juicer. Order a Catch a Fire (apple beets lemon ginger and cayenne) listen to the D.J. spinning tunes in Miss LilyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Variety next door. Serious juice should always be this fun.Perla,New York,West Village,Perla serves a swaggering red-blooded version of Italian food. Enjoying the cooking of Michael Toscano the chef requires a willingness Í¢‘„‘î even an eagerness Í¢‘„‘î to go a little too far and then tell yourself that too far is exactly where you wanted to be. Beef is a specialty like the sauce beef tartare from a Piedmontese cattle breed or the ribeye steak for two blasted in the wood-burning oven to give it a Fourth of July backyard char. 606 R &amp; D,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,Brooklyn artisanal but with a genuine retro twist: the chef Ilene Rosen (ex-City Bakery) grew up in Brooklyn and supports local producers old and new. Playful modern food seriously good with a soft spot for childhood snacks and seasonal produce.Cafe China,New York,Midtown South,Some Sichuan-food fanatics would roll their eyes at CafÍ—‘© China. It looks far too pretty for a place serving a cuisine renowned for its chile-powered ability to make eaters teary-eyed and sweaty. But this quaint demure restaurant serves uncompromising Sichuan food that can stand with ManhattanÍ¢‘„‘Žs best. The kitchen can dance a proper ma la two-step intertwining the heat of chiles and the numbing effect of Sichuan peppers. But it also shows great control of flavors at lower degrees of heat. No MSG is used so the smoked tofu with Chinese celery shoots doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt deliver the same kick in the head youÍ¢‘„‘Žd get at Sichuanese competitors a few blocks away but it does have a clean celery flavor. Even under a blizzard of spices the main ingredients at CafÍ—‘© China taste like themselves. David's Brisket House,Brooklyn,Bedford Stuyvesant,For decades this Brooklyn classic has been turning out the sassiest pastrami sultriest brisket and lean mean corned beef sandwiches in three sizes plus waistline-expanding combos of any two or all three meats. Served warm with pickle spears on the side theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre swooningly good. The fresh corned beef hash is also delectable. Kristalbelli,New York,Koreatown,Korean barbecue goes upscale with smokeless grills made of crystal sommeliers and prices to match. (Fortunately the soju Í¢‘„‘î rice liquor Í¢‘„‘î menu remains affordable.) The food is less punchy than the K-town standard (the meat all Waygu beef isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt even marinated) but the menu more than compensates with extra refinement and quality. EmpellÍ—‘_n Cocina,New York,East Village,Alex StupakÍ¢‘„‘Žs mash note to the food of Mexico resembles its inspiration the way dreams resemble life. Do gorditas usually run with egg yolks when you slice into them? Here they do the yellow yolk curling around smoked plaintains and chorizo. Is the beef tendon in menudo always as puffy and crisp as a snack chip? Here it is; you crunch it between mouthfuls of manila clams dipped in the spicy organ-rich menudo. Watching Mr. Stupak try to pull all this off gives you the giddy feeling you get watching great actors improvise. The adrenaline charge of seeing pure inspiration powers you past the stammers and the stops. Socarrat,New York,Nolita,Churros are the supermodels of the doughnut world: long skinny and vaguely extraterrestrial. At La Churreria they are moist inside yet dry to the touch crisp and fluffy and chewy all at once; dunk them in the accompanying hot chocolate which is served in a coffee cup and so dark and thick it almost counts as a pudding.Alison Eighteen,New York,Flatiron,Alison Price BeckerÍ¢‘„‘Žs return to Manhattan isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt as intimate and romantic as her last place Alison on Dominick which closed in 2002. But itÍ¢‘„‘Žs the kind of restaurant that people used to open in those days and donÍ¢‘„‘Žt so much any more: a place where civilized adults can have an appetizer and an entree in that order and where the kitchen isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt going to try any funny stuff.Kyo Ya,New York,East Village,A Japanese hideaway in the middle of the East Village Kyo Ya gives up its secrets slowly. It is below street level at the bottom of an iron staircase marked by a carved sign that says not too helpfully Open. Once you make you way inside you look around smile and start to unwind. Made almost entirely of wood the restaurant is the kind of room that restores all five of your senses if you have spent your day flicking away at pixels. Kyo Ya is known for its kaiseki dining with a progression of courses featuring seasonal ingredients. It is a rare treat no question but so are many of the individual dishes that can be ordered Í—‘_ la carte with a smaller investment of time and money. If you eat this way your meal will be less epic but it can be just as enjoyable.Pera Soho,New York,SoHo,The Mediterranean small plate puts on downtown garb becoming more fanciful (and flagrantly expensive) on arrival in Soho. Perks: a roomy wood-lined patio good cocktails and some remarkably good eggplant dishes.Speedy Romeo,Brooklyn,Clinton Hill,At this artisanal pizzeria on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant the pies are of the thin-crust variety fired in a wood-burning oven. The dough is more chewy than charred a fine canvas for toppings like smoky house-made mozzarella wild mushrooms and egg or curling petals of sopressata and fennel-infused finocchiona. The rest of the menu is respectable without being exciting. You might not detect that the chef Justin Bazdarich worked for Jean-Georges Vongerichten for a decade. Here he is cooking in a looser less buttoned-up mode and for the neighborhood that is just right. Cochinita,Brooklyn,Clinton Hill,This little Clinton Hill taqueria is modern in aesthetic Í¢‘„‘î red metal chairs angular black banquettes iPad in lieu of a cash register Í¢‘„‘î and ethos: compostable packaging humanely raised meats. But its reverence for Mexican street food is strictly traditional. Tacos are built on a base of two soft corn tortillas made with fresh-ground masa (from TortillerÍ—‘_a Nixtamal in Queens). The finest is the cochinita pibil pork shoulder marinated in achiote and sour orange folded in banana leaves then slow roasted until it practically shreds itself. Rucola,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,In a landmarked corner building dressed in elaborate ironwork this Boerum Hill restaurant does the neighborhood proud with flavorful renditions of Northern Italian dishes like veal spiedini Í¢‘„‘î pan-fried veal and anchovy rolls Í¢‘„‘î and a Bolognese fragrant with rosemary and nutmeg. Along with the requisite charcuterie cheeses and antipasti there are heirloom vegetable salads and branzino crudo scattered with pickled tomatoes basil and toasted sunflower seeds followed by a small list of entrees: fluke in a luxuriant bouillabaissse-like broth; bone-in chicken bathed in jus. By daylight there are lattÍ—‘©s and rich sandwiches including a knockout roast pork speck and provolone. All of it pairs well with the general sense of localsÍ¢‘„‘Ž satisfaction. Acme,New York,NoHo,The awning still advertises Í¢‘„‘ñAuthentic Southern and Cajun CookinÍ¢‘„‘Ž\u201d from the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs last incarnation but the menu now has more to do with Denmark than Louisiana. The chef Mads Refslund was co-chef with RenÍ—‘© Redzepi in the early days of Noma. And though he didnÍ¢‘„‘Žt stay long he still carries that restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs philosophy of searching for unexplored possibilities in the local larder. Now that Mr. RefslundÍ¢‘„‘Žs region is New York this means familiar ingredients treated with an uncommon gentleness and respect. RedFarm,New York,West Village,RedFarm is a collaboration between one of New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs greatest Chinese chefs Joe Ng and one of its greatest Chinese restaurateurs Ed Schoenfeld. (Only one of them Mr. Ng is Chinese by birth.) They have several clever ideas here. First they tailored their menu of modern Chinese cuisine for a Western palate with none of the bland and slippery specialties that non-Chinese eaters find so enigmatic. Second they call the cooking Í¢‘„‘ñChinese cuisine with a Greenmarket sensibility\u201d which boils down to spending more on ingredients than many Chinese restaurants. Finally all the flavors in many of the dishes have been turned up as high as they will go. The dishes can be salty or sweet or rich. Often they are all three at once. Jungsik,New York,TriBeCa,Jung Sik Yim the chef and proprietor was born in Korea and attended culinary school in the United States. As the flavors of his homeland collided with modern American restaurant techniques all sorts of ideas shook loose. The result is this Korean fine-dining restaurant where a suave sabayon with Arctic char is injected with the unruly heat and sourness of kimchi for example. New Yorkers who crave Korean cuisine for its militant strafings of chili paste and raw garlic may find that Jungsik takes some getting used to. Its goal is refinement for better and at times for worse. The food can lapse into dullness and the service veer toward exaggerated courtesy but at its best Jungsik showcases Mr. YimÍ¢‘„‘Žs rare transformative talent.Ngam,New York,East Village,At Ngam Hong Thaimee a native of Thailand who has cooked for the royal family there reinterprets Thai cuisine as modern comfort food. This may mean curry in a potpie or khao soi made with beet ravioli instead of rice noodles. The best dishes however stay close to the originals. And the best place to eat them is at the counter by the open kitchen where the motherly Thai cooks will ask after your health and firmly correct your Thai pronunciation.Allswell,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Nate Smith changes his menu all the time posting a new one on Tumblr each night at around 6. The best of the cooking shows real sensitivity to ingredients with a few British touches Mr. Smith picked up during his time at the Spotted Pig.CaffÍ—‘©bene,New York,Times Square Theatre District,The first American outpost of one of South KoreaÍ¢‘„‘Žs largest coffee chains the caffÍ—‘©bene in Times Square proves that high-quality coffee can be executed on a large scale. Drinks are prepared by skilled baristas on Marzocco machines and served in real cups and saucers. The food menu is vast but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs best to keep it simple: a fresh waffle and a coffee or a misutgaru latte made with toasted barley brown rice black rice black bean and black sesame seed. You never know what youÍ¢‘„‘Žll find in Times Square. Shake Shack,Brooklyn,Downtown Brooklyn,Among the most influential restaurants of the past decade Shake Shack has been studied and copied around the country. Its legacy can be seen not just in the stampede of good cheap burgers but in the growing recognition that certain fine-dining values like caring service and premium ingredients can be profitably applied all the way down the scale. But success has also bred a higher class of competition. Several new rivals now offer a cheap burger that is as good or better and just about everybody makes superior fries.Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria,New York,NoHo,This sibling to the original Il Buco on Bond Street is the cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs most complete realization so far of a powerful myth: the simple and convivial restaurant that tastes just like Italy. To recreate the feeling of a modest restaurant in an Umbrian village Donna Lennard the owner essentially recreated the village. There is a baker making slow-rising artisanal loaves; a grocer selling Sicilian anchovy sauce and other key ingredients; and two cured-meat specialists curing some of the finest salumi in the country. All of these elements come into play during a meal in the dining room. Dinner can and should begin with a basket of bread and a plate of salumi before moving on to composed-plate appetizers very classic and simple pastas and finally hearty and filling secondi many of them made on the rotisserie. The result is a bright and busy room where people are tearing at pieces of bread eating off one anotherÍ¢‘„‘Žs plates and talking with their elbows on the tables.Machiavelli,New York,Upper West Side,A grand artsy homage to Italian food with Renaissance-style murals live piano music and a dedicated pasta chef. Open all day Machiavelli has become an unlikely Renaissance-themed neighborhood hangout for breakfast and afternoon coffee. The menu is vast and pricey but brick-oven pizzas and fresh salads are highlights.Butcher Bar,Astoria,Astoria,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a butcher shop itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a restaurant. Beyond an austere 20-seat dining area framed by blond wood is a showcase for local pasture-raised pork and chicken and grass-fed sometimes grain-finished beef. Meats can be taken home to your kitchen or served on the spot.Kutsher's Tribeca,New York,TriBeCa,Opened by a member of the family that owns a legendary if faded resort in the Catskills KutsherÍ¢‘„‘Žs Tribeca turns all the old jokes about Jewish cooking upside-down. The foodÍ¢‘„‘Žs not bad. And such big portions! The dining room with zigzags of blond wood and banquettes of charcoal leather has a Sinatra-at-the-Sands verve but it is also spacious enough to appeal to the three-generational families that troop in during Hanukkah. Another key to its appeal: ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs got to be one of the least pretentious Í¢‘„‘ñnice\u201d restaurants to open in Manhattan in years. There is no chefÍ¢‘„‘Žs tasting menu but there is a childrenÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu.Crown,New York,Upper East Side,John DeLucie the chef and proprietor cheerfully calls his cooking Í¢‘„‘ñcomfort food for millionaires.\u201d (And for their pets; the kitchen once prepared a cote de bouef for a regularÍ¢‘„‘Žs dog.) The restaurant operates like a public dining room for locals whoÍ¢‘„‘Žve given the cook the night off. Whether you should join them is a question of what you expect when dinner for two runs about $200 before the first drop of wine is poured. Like the work of the best caterers on the Upper East Side most of the cooking at Crown is agreeably dull with occasional pockets of excellence amid some patches of unalloyed boredom.Parm,New York,Nolita,The second restaurant from Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone treats the sandwiches and steam-table contorni of Italian delis as a legitimate subspecies of American cuisine that deserves respect. And respect is what Parm gives it with a wink or two on the side. Almost everything is prepared by cooks wearing white paper hats and set before you in a red plastic basket. And almost everything is completely faithful to your memories while being much much better than you remembered. Most of the main courses can be had on round semolina rolls long hero rolls or as platters with a side of baked ziti or salad. A different special each night of the week provides a reason to come for dinner but the restaurant remains most enticing by day.The Shanty,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,The public face of the New York Distilling Company. It features exemplary cocktails in a comfortable if slightly anonymous setting. The gleaming new still in the adjoining room is the visual centerpiece and the top-notch spirits it turns out (two kinds of gin so far rye to come next year) are the centerpiece of the menu. Littleneck,Brooklyn,Gowanus,This cute shipshape seafood shack near BrooklynÍ¢‘„‘Žs Gowanus Canal serves clams raw steamed in a chowder and in a roll sometimes to tasty effect. Though their crust could be crunchier the clams on the generous roll are huge and sweet; it bests many examples of the townÍ¢‘„‘Žs reigning seafood sandwich the lobster roll. Specials on the oft-changing menu are especially good: crazy-quilt salads of things like pea shoots and popcorn shoots and watermelon radishes; all sorts of raw bar goodes like meaty whelks with drawn garlic butter and sampling of some of the creamiest most interesting oysters to be found in U.S. waters.Sea Witch,Brooklyn,Greenwood Heights,How very satisfying: a bar that has everything all in balanced measure. At this nautically themed pub in Greenwood Heights Brooklyn thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a quaff-worthy selection of fresh and tasty American craft drafts thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a fish tank that can fulfill hours of staring and thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a menu of modest but excellent bar sandwiches at happily affordable prices. Best is the clam Í¢‘„‘ñroll\u201d served on little burger bun and dressed in caper tarter sauce. The clams are fresh crusty and briny sweet and the whole sour pickle on the side seals the deal. Also terrific are the garlicky kielbasa with raw onion mustard and sauerkraut and the juicy tender pork schnitzel its richness tamed by tangy pickles and mustard. The sandwiches are small and so is their price which is great because youÍ¢‘„‘Žll want to keep on ordering them.Corkbuzz Wine Studio,New York,Greenwich Village,A spacious sleek friendly wine bar with a global spin. Laura Maniec who co-owns the place and runs the wine program wants to make wine accessible and fun; the room food and service reflect that light touch. Onegin,New York,West Village,Big and over the top like the palatial Russian restaurants of Brighton Beach but it offers few of their pleasures. ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs no singing no dancing no sequined outfits. Without those enticements the Russian comfort food becomes the focus of the meal and mostly isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt up to the pressure. Whitehall Bar and Kitchen,New York,West Village,British-themed and surprisingly kind of sexy. The attractively stripped-down space signals London with tube-station tiling and park bench banquettes; the bar bustles with a fashionable crowd. Great cocktails old and new with an emphasis on gin. Clever small plates update British classics and make excellent snacks. Forcella,Brooklyn,NoHo,Giulio Adriani seems ready to teach New York a thing or two about authentic Naples-style pizza. And some of the pizzas at Forcella a pizzeria with a flagship in NoHo and a second location in Williamsburg Brooklyn are championship-caliber: the fried-then-baked montanara the four-cheese secondigliano and the lemony fuorigrotta. But other pizzas arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt in the running. Skip the antipasti (unremarkable) the salads (overdressed) and the desserts (clumsy). Stick to the classic pizzas and youÍ¢‘„‘Žll eat well.Lupa,New York,Greenwich Village,For more than a decade Lupa has been a destination for the simple but delicious preparations of Lazio the region of Italy centered around Rome. Tourists and New Yorkers alike are drawn not only by the food but by the star power of the proprietors Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich luminaries now in restaurants books television and wine. Pastas in general are superb but other dishes are inconsistent. At prime times the dining room is packed cramped and loud and food and service seem rushed. At other times the Lupa experience can be a delight. The wine list is excellent.Betto,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Jason Denton is taking a bite out of Brooklyn with this venture featuring bruschette similar to but softer than his signature crostini along with small plates for sharing a few pastas and a frequently changing selections of Í¢‘„‘ñfurred feathered and fish\u201d from small producers mainly roasted and served for one or more.Pulqueria,New York,Chinatown,Heather and Christopher Tierney who own Apotheke next door serve small plates Mexican style with tequila-laced drinks.Seasonal,New York,Midtown,Seasonal a warm Austrian-German bistro combats a gloomy Midtown location with toasty pumpkin-seed oil elderflower syrup veal-cheek goulash and many different house-made noodles and dumplings. Luxurious extras (flavored butters little cups of foamed soup a long list of Austrian and German wines by the glass) make the place feel sure-footed. They have also added dishes like gin-cured oysters with cucumbers to their Austrian menu. Monkey Bar,New York,Midtown East,The time capsule menu is gone. The effort at clubby exclusivity occurred in some other lifetime. The team that's now in charge at Monkey Bar is welcoming and gracious and the restaurant has become an oasis for adults. Damon WiseÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu is now straightforwardly contemporary American. Perhaps itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a bit fussy or overly complex at times but more often his combinations are delicious and of a piece with the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs winking aura of classic New York. CafÍ—‘© de la Esquina,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,The Williamsburg offshoot of SoHoÍ¢‘„‘Žs La Esquina has a friendlier door policy than its Manhattan counterpart. The menu is the same whether you sit in the restored Í¢‘„‘Ž50s diner the gothic nook of a back room or the garden. (The takeout counter is cheaper which in the end may make you happier.) The classically trained chef Akhtar Nawab is of Indian descent and grew up in Kentucky but his Mexican dishes taste as if heÍ¢‘„‘Žs been cooking them all his life.Chuko,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,Three Morimoto veterans downsized from 12000 square feet of glitz in Manhattan to a 35-seat ramen shop in Brooklyn. The ingredients are top-notch and the noodles have tooth but the broths need more time to develop. The unexpected stars of the menu are the vegetables lusty and infused with swagger.Alfama,New York,Midtown East,With few options in Manhattan for Portuguese food Alfama can sate cravings for salt cod chourico fresh wines and creamy desserts but the menu is over-large and the kitchenÍ¢‘„‘Žs execution is hit-or-miss. Maharlika,New York,East Village,It bills its fare as Í¢‘„‘ñFilipino Moderno\u201d which turns out to mean home cooking boosted by good ingredients and classic technique. The dÍ—‘©cor is a cheeky but loving homage to the more kitschy side of the Philippines: Spam and Tang get a nod along with the Filipino Miss Universe of 1973. For Filipino-Americans it feels like home. For everybody else it is an exotic excursion with a soft landing a chance to discover an unsung cuisine without getting too down and dirty. Sushi Yasuda,New York,Midtown East,Sushi Yasuda sets the standard in New York for the pure expression of sushi culture. This quiet contemplative restaurant makes every effort to offer sushi in its traditional form without the creative liberties often taken with ingredients seasoning and portion size. This approach benefits diners when they get into the spirit too perhaps omitting the usual dousing of soy sauce and wasabi in favor of the subtle flavors envisioned by the chef. While itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a serious place for serious sushi lovers a sense of warmth and pleasure pervades.Bien Cuit,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,Artisanal breads and pastries worthy of Paris Í¢‘„‘î and Portland Ore. where the talented baker Zachary Golper learned his trade.Birreria,New York,Midtown South,An all-day year-round rooftop beer garden set above the tempting bustle of Eataly and run by the same Batali-Bastianich team. Depending on weather server and time of day meals here can be idyllic Í¢‘„‘î or uncomfortable and manic. A menu built around beer meat mushrooms and cabbage reflects the cuisine of ItalyÍ¢‘„‘Žs far North but not in a rigorous way. ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs something for everyone even vegetarians Í¢‘„‘î but no pasta or risotto. Rouge et Blanc,New York,SoHo,This tranquil low-key bistro on a quiet side street in SoHo takes a fresh approach to combining France and Vietnam. No splashy homage to colonial decadence here. The action is all on the plate as fresh herbs tangy sauces and other Vietnamese ingredients merge with French techniques and a thoughtful fairly priced list of French wines. Rouge et Blanc lacks polish and consistency but the restaurant intrigues and largely delivers over and above expectations. Saxon &amp; Parole,New York,NoHo,Saxon &amp; Parole with an all-American horsy-but-sleek ambience and a menu of modern surf and turf was conjured up by the same minds that previously invented in the same NoHo space the British-Asian colonial fantasy Double Crown. With its bustle emphasis on cocktails and multitude of seafood platters and small plates seems pitched to younger diners but those middle-aged and beyond wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt find it unappealing particularly if the restaurant smoothes out the inconsistent service and cooking. Among the highlights is a spectacular burger topped with havarti cheese bacon and a fried egg. Blueprint,Brooklyn,Park Slope North,Finally Park Slope has the kind of artisanal cocktail bar itÍ¢‘„‘Žs sorely needed. This quiet place dressed in modest polished woods in the old Long Tan bar space serves carefully balanced drinks along with a well-curated list of charcuterie and cheeses seasonally driven salads and a few choice small plates (decadent brandade; bruschetta on house-baked bread). Skip the bigger dishes graze and relax.Salinas,New York,Chelsea,Salinas is not the new wave Spanish restaurant that many New Yorkers have long craved but in its exploration of traditional Spanish cuisine it demonstrates that the old wave can be rewarding as well. The chef Luis Bollo once cooked at Meigas an excellent Spanish restaurant downtown but it closed shortly after 9\/11. Now after cooking in Connecticut for most of the last decade he returns with confident if not ground-breaking cuisine. The Cannibal,New York,Kips Bay,RestoÍ¢‘„‘Žs Christian Pappanicholas expands with this butcher shop and beer bar where the sudsy esoterica and house cuts and sausages (along with select grocery items) can be consumed here or purchased for home. Snacks are great: tart pickled vegetables stand up to the boudin blanc and duck liver mousse; curried egg toast has lovely Thai flavors. Mains range from a high-end daily steak selection to low-end and delicious Coney dogs.Wild Rise,Brooklyn,Dumbo,ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs just one item at this pop-up restaurant tucked inside a corner bar in Dumbo but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a good one: Neapolitan pizza cooked in a jiffy in a custom electric brick oven. The dough is made with wild Italian yeast; youÍ¢‘„‘Žve rarely eaten a crust so lively and flavorful.Prime &amp; Beyond,New York,East Village,An offshoot of a popular New Jersey restaurant this is a sleek modern spot offering bargains in prime-grade steak aged in house and served with simple Korean-style sides. KulushkÍ—‘_t,Brooklyn,Park Slope,The falafel at this modest and mostly takeout shop in Park Slope is a bundle of contradictions: crisp yet moist airy yet creamy. Buoyed by cilantro and spiked with paprika it has bounce. Beyond the usual classic and spicy versions is a nutty almost smoky falafel infused with mushrooms and a variation made with munificently-spiced ground chicken. Each pita comes with a slap of bracingly tart eggplant Í—‘_ la Yafa named after the mother of one of the owners whose recipes inspired much of the menu.Neerob,Bronx,Parkchester,This modest sunny halal restaurant serves the fish-friendly cuisine of Bangladesh distinguished by the use of mustard oil that thrums through dishes like low-wattage horseradish. The lingua franca is Bengali but servers speak ample English to help first-timers navigate the menu. Tertulia,New York,West Village,A faux Spanish taberna in the West Village Tertulia has the atmosphere of a medieval bar as interpreted by fashion editors. It appears to be Í¢‘„‘ñGame of Thrones\u201d in J. Crew and Uniqlo. But there is beneath the shouting and plaid a terrific casual Spanish restaurant that sees its roots in the cider bars of northern Spain and its success in a cuisine that is equal parts pork and seafood salt and olive oil garlic and smoked paprika. Seamus Mullen the bearish young Vermonter who is the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef cooks with great confidence and skill over the open flames of his wood-burning fireplace and cuts Iberico ham as if slicing salmon at Russ &amp; Daughters. The restaurant is loud. It is still worth visiting.Coppelia,New York,Chelsea,This self-styled 24-hour Cuban luncheonette serves a wide-ranging menu of Latino food from across the Caribbean and into South America and an all-day breakfast menu of the sort to delight barflies insomniacs late-rising drag queens and all those who thrill to the flavor of pressed Cuban toast with eggs. It is done up in sun-faded pastel hues with blue-and-white tiles on the floor a sea-foam pressed ceiling and lovely teal shutters along the west wall that evoke images of old Havana. A long marble counter runs opposite these at which you can sit and drink cafÍ—‘© con leche and eat ropa vieja at dawn reading a tabloid considering options feeling fuzzy or fine. The atmosphere is analgesic. It may not be a restaurant where you would want to celebrate a birthday or a promotion. But Coppelia is exactly right for the morning after and perhaps for the next couple of meals after that. Miss LilyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Favourite Cakes,New York,Greenwich Village,Sightly haute-ified Jamaican food in a diner environment with a beautiful staff assembled by the designer Serge Becker that is as arresting as a tower of giraffes. The restaurant draws a (mostly!) corresponding clientele: tall and casually elegant; friendly but a little otherworldly as if resident in a game preserve. Very few people on Earth can eat jerk chicken and look as the people at Miss LilyÍ¢‘„‘Žs do. But it is credible jerk chicken for all that. Bradford Thompson the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs French-trained chef brines the birds and cooks them low and slow in a humid oven then slathers the pieces in thyme-rich allspice-fantastic jerk sauce and crisps it hard on the grill. Too bad then that so much of the rest of the food falls short. Tabata Noodle,New York,Midtown West,A narrow bustling ramen shop just south of the Port Authority Tabata has excellent broths a few tables and friendly service.St. Anselm,New York,Williamsburg,A charming neighborhood restaurant devoted to the pleasures of open fire with a pulsing bass line of ambition beneath its simple steakhouse melody. Yvon de Tassigny the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs chef has matched great live-fire technique to excellent groceries and reveals himself to be a master of off-cut lamb and beef. And his iceberg salad served below warm bacon vinaigrette that melts a scattering of blue cheese across its top and softens the exterior of the crisp lettuce is among the great things to eat on the north side of Williamsburg Brooklyn. Marvelous lamb is one good reason to come but the steaks are quite good as well as is the pork chop and Mr. de Tassigny is no slouch when it comes to mackerel trout or scallops either. There is no pastry chef and it shows but this is no terrible matter at these prices and the room is pleasant and warm. Craft,New York,Flatiron,There are no shortcuts to excellence at this luxurious and expensive American restaurant that Tom Colicchio opened on the edge of the Flatiron district in spring 2001. No lipstick is available for the pigs. The restaurant a masculine-modernist room done up in leather wood concrete and steel is a luxury experience designed for people willing to spend a great deal of money for only absolute quality. So if there are heirloom tomatoes on the menu they must be the right ones picked at the correct moment and served today or the dish is a failure. Roast sturgeon simply that no more or less than the fish itself? The fish must be coaxed into that state without losing its essence or the dude will not abide. The philosophy of Craft is craft and it is all the more exciting for that. Earl's Beer and Cheese,New York,East Harlem,ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs comically tiny and always packed and it doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt look much like a bar but EarlÍ¢‘„‘Žs has charm in spades. And behind the ironic hunting-lodge whimsy thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs some real culinary smarts. Four taps pour an ever-changing assortment of excellent American niche beers and the chef Corey CovaÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu of goofball cheese-focused bar food does the lowbrow-artisanal thing brilliantly.Nitehawk Cinema,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Now dinner and a movie is easier. Saul Bolton made over the movie-theater usuals and added satisfying comfort dishes and desserts to enjoy while taking in a film.456 Shanghai Cuisine,New York,Chinatown,The setting is dropped-ceiling bland with a few plants and paintings for color resembling nothing so much as a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Behind a shiny storefront and plate-glass window the dining room runs crowded and bright back toward a hectic prep area replete with garbage bags and a dumbwaiter. The kitchen is down a flight of sticky stairs next to the restrooms. The scene is not promising. But real pleasures await. The restaurant serves outstanding soup dumplings and fried fish cold noodles and stir-fries. For those who have prematurely mourned for ManhattanÍ¢‘„‘Žs Chinatown or simply declared its primacy lost to the size and variety of the one in Flushing Queens it is a sign of health.Nights and Weekends,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,This Havana-meets-hipster bar in Greenpoint offers Caribbean-inspired small plates and salads. John Brown Smokehouse,Long Island City,Long Island City,Not long ago New York was bereft of true barbecue save for one outpost called PearsonÍ¢‘„‘Žs in Long Island City Queens. Since its departure notable practitioners of the craft were largely absent from the area until the arrival of John Brown Smokehouse named after the Kansas abolitionist who glares from the takeout menus. Not everything is amazing but thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs so much flavor and tenderness to the pork the lamb sausage and the incomparable burned ends that a dry brisket  and a chewy pit beef donÍ¢‘„‘Žt spoil the fun at this tiny affable place. [Editor's note: This venue changed locations since the original review; the address here reflects that change.]MableÍ¢‘„‘Žs Smokehouse,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,In a way Mable's which brings to town the smoky style of Oklahoma City barbecue is as Williamsburg as you can get: reclaimed wood pickletinis women in pigtails taking orders with Elly May charm. But then you get your food served cafeteria style from the counter. Based on recipes from a co-owner Jeff LutonskyÍ¢‘„‘Žs Oklahoman mother and grandmother (Mable herself) it doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt feel put-on at all. The brisket is smoky tender and moister than any other in these parts. The sauce doled out like liquid gold has lip-smacking tang. And the substantial vegetarian sloppy Joe might make MableÍ¢‘„‘Žs an incongruous destination for non-meat eaters. All are served with freebies: pickled vegetables snappy slaw white bread. Lovable sides like eggy potato salad peppery stewed corn savory borracho beans (Í¢‘„‘ñdrunken\u201d pintos) round out the meal.Roberta's,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Even though RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs is known as a pizzeria itÍ¢‘„‘Žs O.K. to skip the pizzas. Not that thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs anything wrong with them Í¢‘„‘î they're nicely singed in a wood-burning oven Í¢‘„‘î but the kitchen is also turning out subtle and polished dishes in the back like pickled pig's tongue or mackerel which might come with braised lemon jelly and purÍ—‘©ed peas. This is not pizzeria fare and itÍ¢‘„‘Žs not what you expect to find in a part of the Bushwick section of Brooklyn where street traffic seems to be evenly divided between concrete trucks and fixed-gear bikes. RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs fits right in. The restaurant looks like a cinderblock bunker and the beer and wine are served in jelly jars but the food is as confident and relaxed as the scruffy clientele.Danji,New York,Clinton,A wee little restaurant on West 52nd Street done up in whitewashed brick and blond Ikea stylings naked bulbs extension cords and a lot of wooden spoons artfully displayed as if by David Rockwell on a $200 budget. The crowds are fierce.There is a good reason. Hooni Kim who opened this place as a new-style Korean take on a Japanese izakaya is a terrific cook. Those who take the time and care to explore his menu of both traditional and modernized Korean food will be rewarded. Some stipulations: Danji is not a particularly comfortable restaurant. Customers perch on stools along the bar or at high tables in the front of the room or wedge into the few tables in back. There are just 36 seats. It gets quite hot in the dining room as at a crowded party in a small apartment. You would not want to do business there unless your business involves knees touching and the thrill of discovery. So stipulated. Now slide your menu out of the drawer that hides just below the surface of each table. It is time to graze. Boulud Sud,New York,Upper West Side,Daniel BouludÍ¢‘„‘Žs first significant gesture toward the sea that laps at the South of France and Spain to its west then stretches across to Africa and east to the Levant.   Boulud Sud stretches out beige and sunny along West 64th Street all open dining rooms with curving ceilings that evoke Cunard ships and Fred Astaire. (It connects to Mr. BouludÍ¢‘„‘Žs Lyonnaise-ish Bar Boulud via the basement where the restaurants share restrooms.) It is excellent for pre- or post-Lincoln Center dining and otherwise caters to a prosperous neighborhood crowd. The food has its roots in the coastal beauty and casual quayside culture of the Mediterranean. But it is much fancier than that with wine and service to match.Uncle Zhou,Elmhurst,Elmhurst,Uncle Zhou serves homey food from Henan province breadbasket of central China where wheat noodles are the foundation of many meals.Monument Lane,New York,West Village,This rustic-chic bistroÍ¢‘„‘Žs name is a nod to Colonial times in Greenwich Village but the experience is up-to-date complete with cocktail menu platters of American charcuteries and cheese friendly servers and bar snacks like fried pork skins. Later in the evening the crowdÍ¢‘„‘Žs focus moves from the kitchen to the bar.The Leopard at Des Artistes ,New York,Upper West Side,Gianfranco Sorrentino and Paula Sorrentino of the elegant Il Gattopardo on 54th Street have transformed the old CafÍ—‘© Des Artistes space off Central Park West into an airy and cheerful southern Italian clubhouse. (Leopard is English for gattopardo.) Extensive cleaning has removed the nicotine lingerie that clad the bodies of the cavorting nymphs on the old Howard Chandler Christy murals that surround the room revealing copious nubile flesh and shining white teeth. The carpets have been pulled out and replaced with stone floors. Sleek wood veneer has been applied to some of the walls. And the menu which for the last few years of CafÍ—‘© des Artistes ran best to potato chips and cheese dip at the dark and charming bar in the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs rear has become a testament to the rustic joys of Sardinia and Sicily: simple food apparently simply prepared. Legend Bar and Restaurant,New York,Chelsea,At this spiffed-up Sichuan restaurant the chef Ging Den Wang explores traditional dishes and his own variations most of them expertly made highly spiced and served with care to a rotating cast of locals and serious Chinese food lovers. Quality ingredients like duck giant prawns and fresh greens justify the high prices and so does the possibility of drinking a martini along with the meal Í¢‘„‘î Legend has a full bar.Palm,New York,Midtown East,Palm and Palm Too are the first links in an international chain that has 27 locations all of them modeled on the 1926 original on the west side of Second Avenue with its sawdust-strewn floors gruff uniformed waiters and celebrity cartoons on the walls. The flagship restaurant and its annex have in recent years almost a single entity Í¢‘„‘_ a restaurant with a front dining room at 837 Second Avenue (Palm) and a back room on the opposite side of the street at 840 (Palm Too) a combination that is set-ready for new episodes of Í¢‘„‘ñMad Men\u201d missing only ashtrays and a strictly-followed dress code. They are almost entirely interchangeable unless you have been to both enough times to have developed a preference for one over the other. The food at both restaurants is first-rate at least if you stick to the original script of salad and tangy prime-rated beef or salad and massive perfectly acceptable lobster along with potatoes and greens. Most people order steak Í¢‘„‘_ the prime porterhouse if itÍ¢‘„‘Žs available is generally the most crusty without and tender within Í¢‘„‘_ and some want a giant lobster and a very few more than that want a veal marsala or a chicken parm (and theyÍ¢‘„‘Žll regret it). Cut into your buttery meat your buttery potatoes your creamy greens. These are prepared with real skill and care and taste it. Meanwhile look at that sawdust on the floor and the twinkle in everyoneÍ¢‘„‘Žs eyes. Palm may be a chain restaurant. But not on Second Avenue no matter where you sit.Palm Too,New York,Midtown East,Palm and Palm Too are the first links in an international chain that has 27 locations all of them modeled on the 1926 original on the west side of Second Avenue with its sawdust-strewn floors gruff uniformed waiters and celebrity cartoons on the walls.

But not on Second Avenue no matter where you sit.Brushstroke,New York,TriBeCa,With Brushstroke David Bouley is back in business at the corner of Hudson Street and Duane Street where he previously housed Danube and Secession. The space is elegant decorated in steel and stone and what might be miles of reclaimed honeyed wood. The food is prepared by instructors from the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka Japan under the leadership of Isao Yamada who most recently was the chef at Bouley Upstairs. Brushstroke is devoted to a school of Japanese cooking called kaiseki a series of focused intricately composed dishes and the menus are the product of thousands of hours of research and testing. The point is art as much as illustration of their expertise. And the result dutifully prepared falls directly between the poles. Two tasting menus are available along with an Í—‘_ la carte sushi menu for the bar. Pass on the sushi; it is not the point of Brushstroke and may get in the way of understanding it. Instead give way to the process: plates served on a flower-bedecked lacquer tray one after the other offering surprises and the taste of the now.EdÍ¢‘„‘Žs Raw Bar at BeerParc,New York,Midtown South,Whoever invented the lobster club (here called a lobster B.L.T.) must have loved bacon more than lobster. Even so this lobster-roll riff on the lobster club including lettuce tomato avocado and bacon bits as well as nicely seasoned lobster meat has its merits Í¢‘„‘î if you can figure out how to eat it without it falling apart.Lobster Joint,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,There are a lot of lobster-roll purveyors but one of the few with a bar is this soothing blue-hued space in Greenpoint where drinks like a super-spicy Dark &amp; Stormy go great with a tarragon-accented lobster roll sided by snappy slaw a pickle and fries rings chips or the best choice salad.Luke's Lobster,New York,Financial District,Dressed in faux shingles and buoys LukeÍ¢‘„‘Žs seems poised to take over defunct piercing pagodas in malls across the country. This branch serves more of the same barely bound smartly spiced lobster rolls with meat plucked fresh from Maine waters and processed there. The texture is not always perfect but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs pure and loveable nonetheless.The Dutch,New York,SoHo,An aggressively American restaurant from among others the French-trained Italian-cooking world-larder-beating chef Andrew Carmellini. In the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs oak-lined oyster bar up front are men in good suits and better sneakers drinking clear-whiskey Manhattans and sucking down giant head-on steamed Hawaiian shrimp. Across from them in the airy high-ceilinged and very loud bar area a tall blonde woman in a backless black cocktail dress sits all by herself swiping her iPad languidly. Behind her: about what youÍ¢‘„‘Žd get if you handed out meal tickets at the TED conference or the Apple store a few blocks away. It is beautiful up there in the bar with the wide windows open to Prince Street and it is a fine place to eat in late afternoon or late morning or on a whim a place to trade jabs bites of caviar forkfuls of elegant beets with smoked egg yolk to cut the sweet. But for dinner you should endeavor to be seated in back along Sullivan Street where the lights hang low in shades that might be pencil tops as rendered by Claes Oldenburg. It is darker in the back of the Dutch the tables larger and the sound level is low enough that you can hear the hip-hop bounce beneath the roar. What a scene!EmpellÍ—‘_n Taqueria,New York,West Village,It can be fearsomely loud in Alex StupakÍ¢‘„‘Žs brave Mexican restaurant on that odd West Village corner where West Fourth Street meets West 10th Street but one bite of the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs cloudlike chicharrÍ—‘_n with roasted tomato and olive salsa may keep you from running out the door. Golly the music is bad. But a few sips of smooth and elegant reposado tequila along with some of the sangrita Mr. Stupak serves with it Í¢‘„‘î tomato juice thickened with pomegranate and kicked up with chipotle Í¢‘„‘î may make you smile. And a full meal of inventive ceviches and salads and tacos will leave you scratching your head in vague happiness: EmpellÍ—‘_n is a West Village tequila bar that turns into a good restaurant as soon as food hits your table. The Beagle,New York,East Village,To stand out in New York a restaurant needs a fresh concept. Retro? Done. Ditto cocktails and Greenmarket fare. What if you put all three together? That is the idea behind the Beagle the East Village jewel box from Matthew Piacentini who is also an owner of the cocktail-focused Clyde Common in Portland Ore. The first-rate food and mixed drinks together become something less than the sum of the parts. Yuba,New York,East Village,Outside of New York a place like Yuba would be swooned over with its intelligent takes on Japanese cuisine and its impeccably fresh sushi. But on recent evenings it was undeservedly empty. Prices are too steep for the N.Y.U. students nearby the setting too modest for the high fliers at Masa to defect downtown even though YubaÍ¢‘„‘Žs chefs and owners George Ruan and Jack Wei did serious time at Masa and Bar Masa respectively. Purists will rejoice over their precision at sushi but the real surprises (and a few nods to the chefsÍ¢‘„‘Ž Chinese heritage) come on the other side of the menu.  Babycakes,Rockaway Park,Arverne,The vegan bakeryÍ¢‘„‘Žs stand on the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk shares a concession with Motorboat &amp; the Big Banana Ode to the Elephants Rockaway Tacos and Veggie Island.Souvlaki GR,New York,Lower East Side,The breezy chic all whitewashed walls and Aegean blue shutters invokes the Cyclades by way of the Lower East Side. The bougainvillea and the cobblestone may be fake but the spirit is genuine and the food authentic: tender meat with a whiff of char meticulously cubed on skewers or in a pita. Thelewala,New York,Greenwich Village,Unlike other late-night joints the fare is made to order Indian street food at its brightest and most fresh. The menu is short (six rolls three platters four chaats no desserts) and cheap (the most expensive item is $8) Í¢‘„‘î a lime paneer roll and a side of a crunchy soggy satisfying chaat such as behl pori are suitable for any time of dayThe National Bar and Dining Rooms,New York,Midtown East,Here now a lively and comfortable neighborhood bistro in the lobby of the Benjamin Hotel with a smart accessible and not terribly expensive menu written by the silver-haired celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian and executed by Paul Corsentino his chef de cuisine. With wide leather booth seats and a beautiful tiled floor designed along with the rest of the restaurant by David Rockwell the restaurant evokes Europe without ever giving up its American accent. This makes for a nice place to eat. So too the food: simple but not really a menu of standards put through the reinvention machine.Buvette,New York,West Village,Chef Jody Williams has poured decades of experience into this all-day West Village spot where delicious is in the details: the marble bar the polished teapots the piles of toast that accompany everything from steamed eggs to raw-milk cheese from Pennsylvania to oxtail marmalade. The long wine list is Italian-accented; the cocktails elegantly simple.Colonie,Brooklyn,Brooklyn Heights,Long and lean beneath a rough-finished wooden ceiling with a handsome bar in front and a large wall garden of herbs leading to a sepia-toned brick-walled dining room and open kitchen in back this restaurant serves a mostly solid farm-to-table menu of haute American food. With esthetic antecedents in both Frankies 457 on Court Street and Buttermilk Channel also there it seeks to draw young parents and young-at-heart in-laws courting singles and groups of friends from the neighborhood and from afar. Often it succeeds. Alex Sorenson the chef who was at Mas (Farmhouse) serves a familiar menu of eggs and mushrooms and pork belly and scallops and beets. But his cooking does not seem overexposed or needlessly trendy. There is brightness to it a clever happiness that comes through on the plate. Jones Wood Foundry,New York,Upper East Side,The mission to convince New Yorkers that British food is delicious continues on the Upper East Side. Chef Jason Hicks who delivered bistro French for decades at La Goulue and Orsay brings his skills to a cheeky food-driven gastropub with homemade crumpets potted shrimp and steak and kidney pie wrapped in a mahogany suet crust.Brooklyn Fare,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,There are but 18 seats at this exquisite little restaurant attached to a grocery store on Schermerhorn Street in downtown Brooklyn stools before an immense stainless-steel counter facing the kitchen. CÍ—‘©sar Ramirez the chef serves what he wants to: 15 or 20 courses of tiny bites of seafood and in-season vegetables broths and sauces tinctures and herbs. There is no liquor license so customers bring their own and match their wines to the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs serious collection of glassware and to the food. The procession of the meal recalls a luxe sushi bar a meal at Momofuku Ko and a course taken in the kitchen at Eleven Madison Park without being anything at all like any of those. The food is French and Japanese and Italian combined. It is a celebration of the delicious. Cafe Kiev,Brooklyn,Gravesend,This family-run Ukrainian cafe is cheerier and more welcoming than many of the boroughÍ¢‘„‘Žs banquet facilities and dingy holes-in-the-wall serving cuisines of the former Soviet Union. The floor staff which is managed by a young married couple Artem Surjko Iurasov and Alina Allakhveranova speaks fine English. Prices that prompt a double-take. No item exceeds $7. At Cafe Kiev the flavors are quiet but hearty. Bugenina a lovely appetizer of pork threaded with bay leaves and garlic baked sliced thin and served cool is a case in point. Many soups are substantial. Tomato-based solyanka is chock-a-block with bologna kielbasa and assorted boiled meats plus black olives and pickled cucumbers. Half-moon dumplings called vareniki dressed Í—‘_ la minute in butter and fried onions are filled with meat or with potatoes and mushrooms. Blintzes plump with finely chopped eggs onions and mushrooms and touched with dill have a wonderful lightly blistered surface. Giuseppina,Brooklyn,Greenwood Heights,A pizza shop in South Slope Brooklyn GiuseppinaÍ¢‘„‘Žs draws a crowd that runs to neighborhood Brendas and Eddies to their children to people from around the way. It is a simple corner restaurant with a brick oven tended by men in white T-shirts. These characters make good pizza. Chris Iacono the chef and an owner is brick-oven royalty; his brother Mark Iacono is the chef and an owner of Lucali the celebrity-magnetic pizzeria in Carroll Gardens a few miles north. The GiuseppinaÍ¢‘„‘Žs menu as at Lucali is limited: pies and calzones. There are toppings listed on a chalkboard along with a scant menu of wines and beer. Everything cooked takes a while to arrive at your table as if the creation of pizzas was more art than craft which it is. But then a waiter brings a wide and bubbling pie smelling of fresh basil of Parmesan and tomato sauce and the warm-milky scent of mozzarella. The crust is chewy pliant with a dull complexion that belies its great flavor. Others will thrill to the calzone. Leaking ricotta it evokes a Currier &amp; Ives diorama of a New England snowdrift and packs a substantial dairy tang. Paired with a shallow bowl of tomato sauce decorated with a sprig of wild oregano it makes for a lively dinner on its own. Van Horn ,Brooklyn,Cobble Hill,With its painted wood floors cups of crayons on the tables a sound system turned to a civil volume Van Horn Sandwich Shop is as much a tasteful spot for the stroller set as a place to grab a beer and a plate of something fried to eat with your fingers. A tiny kitchen turns out what is basically bar food a small selection of sandwiches and sides with a few soups and salads thrown in for balance. TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre mostly Southern classics cleaned up and scaled down for New York. Exciting when it works; too bad it doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt always come together. Nom Wah Tea Parlor,New York,Chinatown,Opened in 1920 it can credibly claim to have been the first dim sum joint in Chinatown. Today after the gentlest of renovations it has dispensed with metal carts and serves dim sum made to order. Everything tastes fresh and the young new proprietor a nephew of the previous owner has thoughtfully preserved the old-time look and feel: yellow walls red leather booths red-and-white-checked tablecloths and mismatched tea cups some a half-century old.David Burke Kitchen,New York,SoHo,David Burke has restaurants all over the world. This one in the basement of the James Hotel in SoHo is a long brightly lighted almost-not-awkward space serving yet another version of Mr. BurkeÍ¢‘„‘Žs antic New American fare. So there are giant plates of buttermilk fried chicken as a special and bowls of lobster soup with lobster dumplings swimming within them. Cooks use a special duck press to crush prawns into a bowl of spicy pasta. There are dates and bacon for youngsters on dates and a very good selection of wine. Debate it all over a side dish of French fries cooked in smoked beef fat with a dressing of pickled jalapeÍ—‘±os.Junoon,New York,Midtown South,At this Indian palace in the Flatiron district everyone looks good. The restaurant is lighted as if by softly glowing amber. The teak lounge furnishings and long bar up front might have been pulled straight off the floor at ABC Carpet &amp; Home. The enormous dining room at once airy and filled with deeply upholstered chairs and banquettes features both large sandstone sculptures and a steel reflecting pool in which float lotus blossoms under candlelight. Sommeliers wheel linen-covered wine carts about the dining room with quiet efficiency and the conversation bubbles along at a hushed level as at an old-line Italian or French establishment. Imagine a kind of dream-state Del Posto the sort of restaurant where of course you would order a ValpolicellaGrassi with your monkfish tikka. And you should! The food is overall very good.Tulsi,New York,Midtown East,Tulsi is the chef Hemant Mathur's glittering Midtown redoubt of Indian cooking across the street from Sparks. Mr. Mathur was an owner and a chef at the pretty bejeweled Devi in the Flatiron district where he often could be seen fussing nervously at the edges of the dining room before retreating to the kitchen to cook with rare brilliance. Here he does the same dance and if the setting is less attractive louder less special than at his former restaurant it places his cooking in sharper relief. No one in New York makes lamb chops like Mr. Mathur Í¢‘„‘î heavy ugly things caked in yogurt but tasting of gamy perfection Í¢‘„‘î and it is a relief to know that he has brought that entrÍ—‘©e north with him. His Manchurian cauliflower has made the transition as well: a magical dish sweet and fiery worth ordering in multiples even at a small table so that everyone present can thrill to its sweet and heat and guess at the secret ingredient.He serves some terrific curries as well and prawns from the tandoor oven. So it is too bad that the dining room past the pretty bar is so charmless and that the lighting is harsh. It makes the restaurant's great pleasures that much harder to glean. Best Pizza,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,This slice joint with good technique and impeccable ingredients (itÍ¢‘„‘Žs a joint venture between the Brooklyn Star and RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs) elevates classics like garlic knots the square slice and white pie. The chicken parm is one for the ages dark meat dredged in flour and fried to order then served on a singed batard from the wood-burning oven at RobertaÍ¢‘„‘Žs with marinara and house-made mozzarella. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a gooey crispy meaty mess. ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs no easy way to eat it. Not that it should stop you.Red Rooster Harlem,New York,Harlem,Marcus SamuelssonÍ¢‘„‘Žs vibrant restaurant on Lenox Avenue in Harlem is that rarest of cultural institutions one that supports not just the idea or promise of diversity but diversity itself. The scene in the restaurant is amazing from dusk until quite late at night: a pulsing cheerful and virtually always-packed bar that gives way to a crowded and sleek dining room beyond it decorated with the work of local artists and populated by a wide range of New Yorkers. Mr. Samuelsson cooks down and talks down to no one. In doing so he has created something that is at once new and entirely familiar: perhaps the only restaurant in the city to serve alongside corn bread and pickles both cauliflower sautÍ—‘©ed with black vinegar and Jamaican beef patties served with Mexican salsa verde. There are Swedish meatballs and fried chicken oxtails and corn tacos all of it served to a dining room that actually looks like New York City. Edi &amp; the Wolf,New York,East Village,Comfort food from Austria given a sophisticated spin from the same team behind SeÍ—‘_sonal and the commissary for the German mission to the United Nations. Spaetzle is delicate creamy and served in a generous pile; the schnitzel is crisp and billowy. The scene is fashionably casual: pared-down food in a room cluttered with still lifes dried flowers tied to metal grates artillery shells a bouquet of feathers lamps that make you duck.Fishtag,New York,Upper West Side,A strange and frustrating if occasionally marvelous restaurant from the chef Michael Psilakis in a basement on West 79th Street across the street from the Dublin House. A neighborhood joint with aspirations that are somewhat higher than that the restaurant marries solid Mediterranean cooking to a kind of wackadoo cheffy bravado that might bring sea urchin to the table floating in a glass of brackish cloudy seawater as if it were art. (It is not. It is kind of nasty.) Fishtag is a good restaurant trapped inside a bad one. Mr. Psilakis and his chef de cuisine Ryan Skeen are both deeply talented cooks capable of great simplicity and flavor. But too many dishes at the restaurant are overdressed and overcomplicated and the room itself too clattery and uncomfortable. They need to do much less to do more.Wasan,New York,East Village,The chefs Kakusaburo Sakurai and Ryota Kitagawa are natives of Japan and veterans of Inagiku the venerable (and very expensive) Japanese restaurant at the Waldorf-Astoria that closed in 2009. Here their cooking continues to uphold the rigorous techniques of washoku classical Japanese cuisine. But itÍ¢‘„‘Žs more inventive and infused with a sly affection for the chefsÍ¢‘„‘Ž adopted city. Sashimi and sushi are executed ably enough but the excitement is in the small plates. You will want many of them. Consider the remarkably reasonable omakase menus which change nightly.Ai Fiori,New York,Midtown South,Ai Fiori is a winning defense of fine dining in New York City that the chef and restaurateur Michael White opened with the chef Chris Jaeckle in the kitchen. It is an emphatic rejoinder to the trend toward farmhouse tables rustic food and shouting that has so dominated the dining scene in Manhattan at least since the start of the recession. Not really beautiful (itÍ¢‘„‘Žs on the second floor of the Setai Fifth Avenue hotel) and with service that is not quite formal it is still an excellent and enjoyable restaurant with a menu that is a precise and soulful amalgamation of French technique and Italian passion executed with great skill. It turns an Italian lens on haute French cooking to reveal French food as it might be cooked in Como for a table of aristocrats. Eat this food with wines to match Í¢‘„‘î relatively inexpensive Ligurian treasures pulled forth by Hristo Zisovski the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs beverage director Í¢‘„‘î and experience a restaurant that joyously strays from the familiar Italian boundaries of what Mr. White has heretofore cooked in New York. Porsena,New York,East Village,Just what a small Italian restaurant in the Village should be: warm modern cozy and hip with an all-Italian wine list and food that is simple but not boring. Chef Sara Jenkins has built a menu around a few rock-star pasta dishes that reconcile Italian and American notions about pasta (spare on the one hand hearty on the other). Desserts surprisingly are excellent. Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan,Flushing,Flushing,A spare and modern restaurant on FlushingÍ¢‘„‘Žs Main Street north of the Long Island Expressway and six blocks south of the final stop on the No. 7 train. Despite its odd intramural name it is devoted entirely to the cooking of Hunan the small interior province of China that was the birthplace of Mao. There are a few tables most of them large and all of them generally crowded from about 7 p.m. on Í¢‘„‘î and sometimes at lunch as well. There are portraits of the chairman hung high on the walls a Pop Mao rather than a political one. The lighting is bright the service right on the line between brusque and affable. It is clean and pretty though not a restaurant where anyone will ask you if you prefer sparkling water to still. And the foodÍ¢‘„‘Žs terrific. Smokier and more simply assertive in its preparation and taste than the cuisine of Sichuan province to which it is often compared Hunan cooking evokes life in mountain basins and alongside tributaries of the Yangtze. At Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichaun Chen Gangyi the chef and an owner interprets it beautifully.Mile End,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,This is the delicatessen circa 2011: beautiful and earnest young people in architect eyeglasses sipping wine and eating chopped liver on pletzel like a canapÍ—‘©. Mile End named after MontrealÍ¢‘„‘Žs historically working-class Jewish quarter is a loving tribute to the deli tradition whose guilty cholesterol-laden pleasures are uplifted here with first-class ingredients. By day it sells QuÍ—‘©bÍ—‘©cois bagels and smoked meat; by night the kitchen turns out artisanal versions of home-style Ashkenazi food such as cholent and kasha varnishkes. The Fat Radish,New York,Lower East Side,A spare loftlike restaurant on lower Orchard Street with a beautiful crowd and a menu that is British after a fashion rustic at that lighter than its promise often more flavorful. The dining room is beautiful and airy a space that might have been a sweatshop once but now belongs to art directors. (Really it was a sausage factory.) Old plaster and hand-lettered signs are still visible on the bare brick walls a cityÍ¢‘„‘Žs palimpsest. GrÍ—‘_ner flows like water and attractive servers in plaid shirts hustle this way and that delivering food. It is mostly very good an oft-changing list of farm-to-tabley salads and lightened-up gastro-pub standards and raw-bar treats. Gottscheer Hall Tap Room,Ridgewood,Ridgewood,Part of a social hall that has catered to generations of German immigrants the taproom serves comfort food with an old-country accent in a casual and companionable setting.The John Dory Oyster Bar,New York,NoMad,A maddening no-reservations policy makes it difficult for anyone who doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt have time or young legs to stand around waiting for a table but the food is incredibly good. April Bloomfield the chef who also has the Spotted Pig in the West Village and the porkish Breslin next door in the Ace Hotel turns out to be a seafood savant. From the cilantro- and chili-spiked mignonette she uses to accompany the wide selection of cleanly-shucked oysters at the top of the meal through the soft and salty joy of her Parker House roll accompanied by smoked arctic char into a salad thick with crab and threaded with puntarelle through a lobster bisque of ridiculous depths of flavor and a kedgeree that might have pleased Kipling the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs pleasures rise and tumble like waves against the shore. There are no entrees on the menu just small plates followed by desserts (including a wee though excellent Eccles cake) but the John Dory Oyster Bar is a fully realized and exciting restaurant all the same an open clattering space behind giant windows with excellent service and a marvelous wine list.Jeffrey's Grocery,New York,West Village,It looks like a corner market with pressed-tin ceilings that carries the kind of peanut butter you like but itÍ¢‘„‘Žs really a restaurant: there are rillettes braised meat dishes and a wine list 35-bottles deep. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs as if Mr. Hooper took a charcuterie class and developed a taste for Willamette Valley pinot noir. It feels calculating at night but if you ignore the happy-hour crowd Í¢‘„‘î and skip the main courses Í¢‘„‘î you can indulge in a plateau de mer an assortment of shellfish as generous as it is gorgeous. Point Brazil,Astoria,Astoria,This simply decorated sunny Brazilian buffet is infused with a companionable hum of conversation among family and friends. Specialties from the northeastern state of Bahia are offered on the first Saturday of each month.Mehtaphor,New York,TriBeCa,Jehangir Mehta made his name as a brilliant and contrarian pastry chef more inclined to shock the palate than to tickle it. But at this restaurant where he is in charge of the whole meal he seems to have mellowed. The best dishes Í¢‘„‘î crab and truffle goat cheese pizza; shaved foie gras with raspberry compote on toast; a grown-up PB&amp;J; an ice cream sundae Í¢‘„‘î do not demand thought. They just please. Millesime,New York,Midtown South,A smart French establishment from the talented chef Laurent Manrique spread out over the back of the second floor of the Carlton Hotel on Madison Avenue and 29th Street. It isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt easy to get to precisely. There are staircases involved an elevator if you like. But holy cats is there a beautiful exciting brasserie up there a restaurant devoted to the pleasures of the sea that manages to be both luxurious and humble ambitious and rustic all at once. The atmosphere is festive and urban pleasant in the extreme. Waiters bustle this way and that in long aprons and black vests as Samy Kebbab the restaurantÍ¢‘„‘Žs effusive and seemingly omnipresent maitre dÍ¢‘„‘ŽhÍ—‘‰tel rushes that way and this managing the room as if it were a party Í¢‘„‘î a master of the hotel in the truest sense. Eat eat! Brad's,New York,Greenwich Village,Jeremy Wladis the owner of BradÍ¢‘„‘Žs a casual spot for sandwiches pizza and beer on the Columbia campus has opened another one next to New York University. Like the original it is named for his father.Buka,Brooklyn,Clinton Hill,Buka serves traditional Nigerian fare in an airy shabby-chic setting catering to expats and intrepid eaters with giant land snails goat head stew and fiery pepper soup a dish that appears on the Lonely PlanetÍ¢‘„‘Žs Top 10 list of the worldÍ¢‘„‘Žs hottest foods. Crowd-pleasers like black-eyed pea fritters and spicy beef skewers are also on hand so you neednÍ¢‘„‘Žt be adventurous to dine here.Anella,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,An intimate little art house of a restaurant on a cold block in Greenpoint Brooklyn with a narrow bar and dining room that are warm as candlelight decorated in that nice urban variation on farmhouse chic that is common to restaurants in north Brooklyn all brick and reclaimed hardwood with Edison bulbs hanging from the tin ceiling that cast shadows over pockmarked plaster and ancient paint. The chef is a talented fellow named Joseph Ogrodnek who offers bread fresh-baked in a flower pot to start followed by a tightly focused menu of simple seasonally appropriate food. Mr. Ogrodnek is a skilled practitioner of the vegetable arts. Like Midas who turned everything he touched into gold (and like Dave Pasternack at Esca in Midtown who achieves similar results with fish) he elevates the simplest greens and tubers into realms more celestial than those we generally experience in restaurants in Brooklyn where the entrees average around $25.Eolo Sicilia a Tavola,New York,Chelsea,An ambitious attempt in Chelsea to present Sicilian food beyond square pizza with many unique flavors and excellent desserts.Cascabel Taqueria,New York,Upper East Side,Every night is spring break at Cascabel Taqueria. An after-work crowd orders cucumber and cilantro margaritas before moving on to crab fritters with piquillo aioli heart-stopping short ribs and ambitious tacos. Simpler is better: carnitas or carne asada tacos and that tequila-absorbing staple queso fundito.Tacombi at Fonda Nolita,New York,Nolita,Tacombi @ Fonda Nolita brings a YucatÍ—‘n beach-shack vibe to the skinny-jeans crowd with comforting (if uncompetitive) tacos tamales and the occasional tostada served from a vintage VW van. A plate of sweet corn or short-rib tacos and a fresh horchata is a fine way to spend seven more dollars in Nolita.Cafe Kristall,New York,SoHo,About a year and a half ago Cafe Kristall was added to the Swarovski Crystallized Boutique in SoHo. The cafe was all sparkly mainly white and beige with light food and drinks by the Austrian chef  Kurt Gutenbrunner. The cafe and the menu have been redone and are more Austrian. (Swarovski too hails from that country.) The dÍ—‘©cor is decidedly Viennese with burgundy Josef Hoffmann fabric Thonet chairs and Expressionist posters. The chef Francis Reynard is serving open-face sandwiches salads soups and entrees like spaetzle with rock shrimp and a classic Wiener schnitzel.  Mr. Gutenbrunner said he hoped the revised cafe would be a somewhat Í¢‘„‘ñhipper\u201d version of his CafÍ—‘© Sabarsky in the Neue Galerie.Riverpark,New York,Kips Bay,It is hard to find places in Manhattan that are hard to find. But Riverpark qualifies. A shimmery addition to the empire of Tom Colicchio it is on the ground floor of a building filled with biotech companies at the end of a private street on the far eastern shore of Kips Bay between the New York University Medical Center and the sprawling wards of Bellevue Hospital. Nighttime foot traffic is nil. It is hard to see it developing an evening core of regular customers. But the menu captivates and it is a pretty restaurant all the same: a leather-filled and pin-lighted dining room with marvelous views absolutely in the design mold of Mr. ColicchioÍ¢‘„‘Žs other properties though somewhat chillier in aspect. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs worth a visit for the adventure alone. And certainly you can eat well. Sisha OrtÍ—‘_zar the chef who opened the restaurant under Mr. ColicchioÍ¢‘„‘Žs watch cooks a menu that bounces around the globe in search of flavor then places it on each plate as if it were an American gift. Osteria Morini,New York,SoHo,A casual if riotously loud SoHo restaurant dedicated to the food and drink of Emilia-Romagna in the north of Italy. There are hefty farmhouse tables covered with paper placemats heavy chairs in various colors and everywhere knickknacks and curios and hanging copper pots and farm tools framed photographs books. As for the food when Michael White the chef and an owner was there it hummed. When he was not the kitchen wobbled. His menu puts Italian traditions through the American super-size machine. There is enough duck-liver mousse in his antipasto portion to spackle a room Í¢‘„‘î and to engorge a dinerÍ¢‘„‘Žs stomach before his meal has even properly begun. His pastas (and he is a pasta maven of the first order) glisten with pork fat with butter with cream with oil. They are aggressively salted. They hang around on the outskirts of Too Much. Bottles of lambrusco are on practically every table. This frothy purple wine is a signature of Emilia-Romagna and the list at Morini is rich in its various pleasures. For those who remember only the soda-pop flavors of the Me Generation lambruscos that once flooded the United States the options here will serve as an excellent re-introduction.CariÍ—‘±o,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,CariÍ—‘±o is a genial place to spend an evening its version of Mexican food reliable if a trifle subdued. The cooks who hail from Puebla and Oaxaca are nimble with the standards and the bar offers an impressively curated list of tequilas and mezcales.The Tangled Vine,New York,Upper West Side,The Tangled Vine is an excellent wine bar on the Upper West Side. The Mediterranean dishes and the extensive largely European wine list will challenge jaded palates without alienating those who long for the familiar. Recommended dishes: crostinis beet salad Pizzetta alle vongole sauteed pea shoots veal meatballs pork montaditos fideos negros cheeses.Pies Í¢‘„‘ƒNÍ¢‘„‘Ž Thighs,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Pies Í¢‘„‘ƒNÍ¢‘„‘Ž Thighs reopened in March 2010 still within earshot of the rumbling Williamsburg Bridge but cleaned up and respectable in most other ways. If the old space was the answer to a dive-bar drunkardÍ¢‘„‘Žs prayer the current one is simply a BrooklyniteÍ¢‘„‘Žs imaginary version of a meat-and-three in the South. But how are the thighs? As crunchy and golden as ever. And how are the pies? Honest American and sweet theyÍ¢‘„‘Žre enough to restore the faith of anybody whoÍ¢‘„‘Žs eaten too many fancy desserts that look like Frank GehryÍ¢‘„‘Žs rejected sketches.Kaz an Nou,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,Kaz an Nou whose name means &amp;quot;our house&amp;quot; in Antillean Creole is a tiny romantic French-Guadeloupe eatery run by a charming young couple who make earthy comforting food and tend thoughtfully to their guests making everyone feel at home. Recommended dishes: cod fritters pheasant pÍ—‘¢tÍ—‘© smoked jerk chicken breast duck leg confit lamb lasagna West Indian-style burger with avocado salsa goat cheese and fried egg.The Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges,New York,Upper East Side,The Mark by Jean-Georges is the multibarreled name of the restaurant on the ground floor of the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side. The chef naturally is Jean-Georges Vongerichten. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a safe play for him: a simple two-star restaurant for a neighborhood that doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt want to be pushed too hard in any one direction (and certainly not toward big powerful spices). And it is very pleasant for that a power-player dining room where you can hear yourself talk with good casual service that marks the restaurant as slightly less formal than its only real competitor in the neighborhood CafÍ—‘© Boulud one block away.No. 7 Sub,New York,NoMad,At this takeout shop a Manhattan offshoot of the venturesome Brooklyn restaurant No. 7 the chef Tyler Kord stuffs submarine sandwiches with ceviche and broccoli layers roast beef with pickled blueberries and lamb with peanut butter and tosses in extras like candied wasabi papadams fried lemon and fermented soybean paste. The results for the most part are delicious Í¢‘„‘î exhilaratingly so. Recommended sandwiches: roast beef; asparagus; braised lamb; ceviche; eggplant parm.Bistro VendÍ—‘‰me,New York,Sutton Place,A neighborhood bistro for a very expensive neighborhood Bistro VendÍ—‘‰me grafts an Upper East Side service ethos onto an undemanding French menu. Cozy but not clubby the trilevel space offers something for everyone with a cashmere sweater. Recommended dishes: endive salad; lobster Caesar salad; steak au poivre; roasted scallops; mussels; raspberry gratin; crÍ—‘Îme brÍ—‘_lÍ—‘©e.Nello,New York,Upper East Side,A restaurant that fits the Upper East SideÍ¢‘„‘Žs reputation of catering to elite Manhattanites. The prices are high even if not much of the food is worth it. But thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs not the point for the patrons of Nello who come dressed in the clothes found in fancy boutiques lining Madison Avenue. The dining room can be crowded at 3 p.m. or midnight.Bakeri,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Cozy and ambitious. It makes its own bread simmers its own jam and even churns its own butter. And then there are the cookies and cakes and brioche rolls with candied ginger. The coffee is exceptional with beans from Counter Culture Coffee. The sandwiches are hit or miss though the Italian oil-packed tuna served on a still-warm ciabatta is always good. Recommended dishes: brioche with candied orange; hazelnut and chocolate chip cookie with rosemary and sea salt; coffee cake; savory bread pudding; Spanish tortilla; tuna sandwich in ciabatta.Culture Espresso Bar,New York,Midtown South,One of the few serious coffee bars in Midtown the focus is firmly on what comes out of La Marzocco. There is also an impressive selection of pastries and sandwiches and while some options feel dated everything is fresh. Iris Cafe,Brooklyn,Brooklyn Heights,Hidden away on one of the sleepiest (and prettiest) cobblestone streets in Brooklyn Heights the fare is simple and good while the coffee made with beans from Stumptown Coffee Roasters is excellent. Try the buttery ham and cheddar biscuit with a soft-boiled egg then get a dozen eggs from the &amp;quot;grocery&amp;quot; Í¢‘„‘î really just a cupboard and half a deli case. Recommended dishes: ham and cheddar biscuit with soft-boiled egg; yogurt and granola; coffee; pastrami sandwich; egg salad sandwich.Ground Support,New York,SoHo,It has the airy feeling of the art gallery that once occupied the space. Tourists and locals sit at rough wood tables and enjoy well-crafted espresso drinks single-origin Chemex drip coffee cold-brew iced coffee and a range of pastries and sandwiches.Joe,New York,Greenwich Village,Joe has reinvented itself: it started buying beans from Ecco CaffÍ—‘© a highly regarded roaster; it retrained its staff; and it streamlined its locations giving extra space to upgraded coffee gear. You can taste the difference. The macchiato is a work of art and in the late morning when the crowds die down some branches offer pour-overs with single-origin beans.Kaffe 1668,New York,TriBeCa,In some ways Kaffe 1668 is a neighborhood cafe; in other ways itÍ¢‘„‘Žs an orthodox coffee bar. For New Yorkers on the run there are lattes in paper cups and jumbo cookies. But for the obsessed there is drip coffee from a Clover machine or seasonal single-origin espresso which the baristas refuse to serve in a cappuccino because the milk would mask the flavor.Knave,New York,Midtown,Le Parker Meridien converted a soaring vaulted corridor into one of the most ceremonious settings in New York for a cup of coffee. And at $6 for a cappuccino itÍ¢‘„‘Žs one of the most expensive cups as well Í¢‘„‘î though the anise-scented cookie that comes with every cup takes away some of the sting.La Colombe Torrefaction,New York,TriBeCa,A Philadelphia company known for its darker roasts. It opened a loft-like TriBeCa storefront in 2007 and a more streamlined coffee bar in SoHo in 2009.La Colombe Torrefaction,New York,SoHo,A Philadelphia company known for its darker roasts. It opened a loft-like TriBeCa storefront in 2007 and a more streamlined coffee bar in SoHo in 2009.Strip House,New York,Greenwich Village,As the name suggests there's a burlesque theme hard at work at Strip House. The walls are lined with lust-red flocked wallpaper and the banquettes are upholstered in quilted red leather. Vintage photographs of old-time strippers cover the walls. It all makes for a cheery comfortable atmosphere with none of the backslapping locker-room style of the old-line steakhouses. And yet Strip House plays it straight with the steaks. The meat is respectable but not much more than that. True worshipers at the altar of red meat will find Strip House insufficiently pagan while younger diners might feel that there's a little too much uptown in this downtown spot.This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef,New York,East Village,The Staten Islanders from the popular Artichoke Pizza and Led Zeppole serve up just a few beef sandwiches and a few sides at this sliver of a spot in the East Village. But if they served nothing but the hot roast beef on a soft eggy roll with an oniony au jus and Cheez Whiz it would be worth the while to stop in. The spicy thick-sliced pastrami paired with hot mustard and sweet slaw is another good option.Testaccio,Long Island City,Long Island City,Testaccio opened in December 2009 bringing a Roman menu (at friendly prices) to Long Island CityÍ¢‘„‘Žs Restaurant Row. Sometimes the chef Ivan Beacco gets everything right: sunflower-like fried artichokes; soft gnocchi with roasted exteriors glazed with tomato and gilded with cheese; the smokiness of guanciale in bucatini allÍ¢‘„‘Žamatriciana; an overlay of bottarga on spaghetti with garlic and clams. An ambitious special of tongue with green sauce sharpened by lemon worked as did the simple olive and tomato condiments that come with bread. The room is plated with stone and metal but comfortable and dinner draws families and mad-hatted hipsters. Testaccio has some low moments Í¢‘„‘î like over-topped pizza and over-priced desserts Í¢‘„‘î but the chocolate-coffee tortino is breathtakingly bittersweet and good. Recommended dishes: fried artichokes bean salad with pork tomato salad tongue with green sauce bucatini allÍ¢‘„‘Žamatriciana gnocchi alla romana spaghettoni with clams lamb chops chocolate-coffee tortino.Baohaus,New York,East Village,This tiny spot on the Lower East Side specializes in gua bao a k a Taiwanese hamburgers. The ingredients are top-notch and the cooking soulful thanks to recipes passed down through three generations. Recommended dishes: Chairman Bao (Niman Ranch pork belly bun); haus bao (Angus skirt steak bun); Uncle Jesse (pan-fried tofu bun); sweet bao fries; beef noodle soup.Tanoreen,Brooklyn,Bay Ridge,Couples slide into tables at Tanoreen Rawia BisharaÍ¢‘„‘Žs marbled Levantine restaurant on the corner of Third Avenue and 76th Street in Bay Ridge lately expanded from its tiny birth site in a storefront one block south. They join families with children friends meeting friends. It is a terrific neighborhood restaurant a lively happy scene set beneath clouds of lamb mint and garlic scents combined.Motorino,New York,East Village,The Brooklyn location closed but this Manhattan location remains offering pies that are great hot out of the oven five minutes later 10. You can go there order too much watch a pie go cool on the plate eat it anyway and discover: terrific. You can order pizzas to take out drive them across the boroughs in freezing conditions get home and reheat the pies: still terrific. Even a slice in the morning fridge-cooled mozzarella over tangy red sauce exhibits the pliancy and flavor of bread not cardboard. This is the taste of a good restaurant.Raoul's,New York,SoHo,A Prince Street mainstay since the mid 1970s RaoulÍ¢‘„‘Žs is Paris in New York BerlinÍ¢‘„‘Žs Paris Bar in SoHo a taste of the Manhattan found in Sondheim lyrics. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs the place people are looking for when they walk off the campus at State for the last time make the move east. Steak frites and a vin rouge can Í¢‘„‘î just like that Í¢‘„‘î become the taste of home. The fancier stuff on the menu is just that but the old classics hold strong and the scene is as swinging and beautiful and arty as ever. Recommended dishes: frisÍ—‘©e salad steak au poivre.Roman's,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,Roman's from the owners of Diner and Marlow &amp; Sons in Williamsburg seems to have an Italian model in mind but it hasn't provided enough choices to make that model work. There are starters pasta and mains Í¢‘„‘î around three of each which makes it hard for a table of two or more to assemble a meal without redundant ordering. Portion sizes run the gamut from idiosyncratic to infuriating. But the restaurant's most rewarding aspect is its cooking which is clean almost monastically pure. The menu changes daily but for examples of what the kitchen does well consider a small plate of sauteed bay scallops not-quite-dressed in olive oil sea salt and balsamic vinegar or a bowl of fresh tagliatelle in a textbook ragÍ—‘_ bolognese.Fu Run,Flushing,Flushing,Formerly Waterfront International this bright friendly restaurant near the 7 train specializes in Beijing and Northeast-style Chinese food. Do not miss the Muslim lamb chops crusted with cumin and chilies lamb-and-carrot dumplings and pork with orange sauce (sticky but good).Golden Palace,Flushing,Flushing,Modest but tasty with home-style cooking from China's Northeast region. Try chicken-mushroom stew tiger vegetable (a salad of cilantro and scallion) and fried cakes of pork with chopped pickled cabbage.NovitÍ—‘,New York,Gramercy Park,A designer shoe box of a restaurant around the corner from Gramercy Park NovitÍ—‘ is perfect neighborhood trattoria. NovitÍ—‘ has improved since it opened in 1994 when Ruth Reichl awarded in one star as the chef Marco Fregonese has moved away from some of the ornate fussy preparations that used to mark his cooking and toward a plain and hearty style well suited to longevity. The pasta is excellent and you wonÍ¢‘„‘Žt go away hungry; the plates are food not art. Papaye,Bronx,Fordham Heights,Located on a sunny corner of the Grand Concourse within eyeshot of the giant baroque Loews Paradise Theater Papaye serves Ghanaian cooking that can be deeply satisfying. The restaurant (the name means to be virtuous or to do good for yourself in the Ghanaian language Twi) is as sparingly decorated as the Paradise is ornate. A typical meal is a one-course affair consisting of a soup or stew. Beco,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Beco calls itself a boteco (also known as a botequim) a Brazilian institution thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs a cross between a bar and a coffee shop. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs a laid-back place to get a drink. But Beco is nominally a restaurant with classic dishes like pÍ—‘£o de queijo and feijoada. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs solid cooking that doesnÍ¢‘„‘Žt try to do too much tasty food to accompany a beer or two and the Corinthians game on TV.Northern Spy Food Company,New York,East Village,The greenmarket-driven Northern Spy offers down-home cooking executed with a precision honed in high-end kitchens. The menu reads like a roster of favorite snacks and midnight feasts. Its greatest hits are carb-heavy: griddled corn bread daubed with sweet-onion yogurt; roasted potatoes spiked with hot mustard; runner beans so dense and creamy that one diner mistook them for mashed potatoes. An actual store occupies the back stocked with local artisanal goods.Ed's Chowder House,New York,Upper West Side,This second-floor restaurant in the Empire Hotel retains some of the look of Center Cut the steakhouse it once was. But the menu is now devoted to fish-shack cuisine: chowders; fried things; butter; lemons. The contrast is stark and the food not particularly good though the chowder will do in a pinch: late to Lincoln Center famished in need of a beer.Henry Public,Brooklyn,Cobble Hill,From the owners of Brooklyn Social comes a pub that honors the boroughÍ¢‘„‘Žs illustrious past with ephemera drink names and a &amp;quot;bill of fare&amp;quot; that evokes the Brooklyn of Walt Whitman and Henry Ward Beecher. Artisanal twists on classic cocktails complement dishes like delicious turkey leg sandwich &amp;quot;hamburger sandwiches&amp;quot; fresh oysters and cross-cut marrow bones.Madangsui,New York,Koreatown,The best of Manhattan's Korean barbecue restaurants Madangsui occupies a large loft-like space on 35th Street just west of Fifth Avenue. Banchan the side dishes central to Korean dining are excellent as are the restaurant's fat savory pancakes. But you are here for barbecue: fresh butterflied short rib for instance or spicy marinated pork cooked on the gas grill in each table and eaten with fresh romaine slaw soybean paste and hot sauce. Wash it down with beer and cold noodle soup. Repeat!Tipsy Parson,New York,Chelsea,Tipsy Parson is a grandmotherly Chelsea restaurant serving small-town restaurant fare Í¢‘„‘î fried pickles deviled eggs strip steak Í¢‘„‘î from the team behind Little Giant on the Lower East Side. There is a trompe l'oeil library on the wall up front in the bar and a long narrow mirror running back through bric-a-brac to the dining room in the rear. It's crowded at night filled with scenesters with sharp elbows and someplace better to be; lunch and tea bring the lazy and sweet. CharlesÍ¢‘„‘Ž Country Pan Fried Chicken,New York,Harlem,Charles GabrielÍ¢‘„‘Žs celebrated buffet and its superb fried chicken got back in the game after being sidelined for nearly a year. Mr. Gabriel's pan-frying technique which he learned in the countryside near Charlotte N.C. and honed in Harlem has him staying by the stove and turning the chicken repeatedly. He raises the bar further by adding seasoning at three stages first through a dry rub that works its effects for a number of hours then via the egg wash and then in the flour dredge. The result is a thin crisp crust encasing meat thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs juicy but never greasy; each piece is luscious and flavorful through and through.A Voce Columbus,New York,Upper West Side,The chef Missy Robbins is a cool character. She cooks rustic Italian food and sends it out of the kitchen looking like modernist plate paintings little sculptures edible art. The colors delight and the flavors redouble the feeling: salt against acid against the sweet meat. Ms. Robbins who has a sure hand with pasta is an excellent chef. She didnÍ¢‘„‘Žt come here to mess around. But make no mistake. A Voce is a corporate enterprise and feels like it. Service is clinical almost silent beyond language. Wine is what a chairman would expect what most would order: a lot of big California cabernets excellent chardonnays. Bill's Bar and Burger,New York,West Village,Stephen Hanson opened this place in the old Hog Pit space hoping to print money. There are sticky blue-checked tablecloths on tall tables in the crowded brick-walled bar ESPN playing high in the corners hotel people streaming past outside a waiter in a sweatband delivering hamburgers fries chicken wings more beer. The fries aren't bad: russet-hued salty and plentiful. And the burger? It is amazingly both crusty and underdone underseasoned; it soaks its supermarket bun into a pulpy submission. It has no flavor. It is deeply uninteresting. GÍ—‘_llÍ—‘_oglu,New York,Midtown East,This trim Turkish bakery and cafe Í¢‘„‘î like its sibling in Brooklyn it's an outpost of a company in Istanbul Í¢‘„‘î has all the makings of a proper meal. See what's freshest in the bakery case in back: maybe a sampler of boregi phyllo pastry filled with beef spinach or cheese Flag down your server for cilbir a sublime retort to omelets which dunks a poached egg in cool yogurt aswirl with olive oil and paprika. GÍ—‘_llÍ—‘_oglu's baklava prepared daily in Brooklyn are less drippingly sweet than the overly familiar Greek version. Oceana,New York,Times Square Theatre District,This new iteration of Manhattan's venerable Oceana opened in the summer of 2009 on the ground floor of the McGraw-Hill Buliding on 49th Street west of 6th Avenue. It is a massive restaurant open and white and blue and tiled with enormous lamp fixtures that throw light into every crevice of the room with giant flowers to soften that and beneath them deep leather booths with velvet backs and walnut trim. Those who order carefully Í¢‘„‘î the raw bar followed by whole fish or simple preparations Í¢‘„‘î will partake of fabulous meals. They will certainly drink good wine. But if the Oceana of old was a pleasant shipshape room with elegant food and a caring touch this new one is a high-functioning luxury mill designed to service pre-theater crowds and to celebrate corporate success on expense-account dimes. Still it is in some ways a very good restaurant. Umi Nom,Brooklyn,Bedford Stuyvesant,The menu at this restaurant at the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill consists of artfully composed small plates of Asian comfort food Í¢‘„‘î like sauteed sweet sausage; pork-belly adobo and bahay kubo fried rice Í¢‘„‘î elevated by technique but primal in appeal. Aureole,New York,Times Square Theatre District,Aureole a restaurant that Charlie Palmer first opened in 1988 on the Upper East Side closed in summer 2009 and reopened in much larger quarters on the ground floor of the Bank of America building on 42nd Street. It's a very different restaurant one that better reflects Mr. Palmer's experience cooking in Las Vegas where he has yet another Aureole than it does his past off Madison Avenue. Le Relais de Venise LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰te,New York ,Midtown East,Le Relais de Venise EntrecÍ—‘‰te is a mouthful of a restaurant that opened a few months ago in a canyon at Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street convenient mostly to hotel guests and hamsters on the Midtown professional wheel. It has no real menu to speak of. There is only salad and steak frites. Some wine to drink and a dessert after. Women in French maid outfits serve the stuff as if they were characters in an early Preston Sturges film. And you know what? ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs terrific.The model is an old one although new to New York. There are LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰tes in Paris and London in Bahrain and Barcelona. The first was established in Paris in 1959 in what had been a Venetian-themed restaurant called naturally Le Relais de Venise. The founder was a winemaker Paul Gineste de Saurs who thought having a restaurant might help build a market for the grapes his family had been growing for centuries.Le Relais de Venise did not flourish on the strength of its wine list however. Lacking restaurant experience M. Gineste de Saurs had limited ambition. He thought only to offer a salad to start and then a grilled cut of sirloin the French call entrecÍ—‘‰te (and which we call strip steak) with a rich buttery sauce and a copious amount of fries.He took no reservations; you simply showed up and were seated. Those decisions turned out brilliantly. They were an assault on the tyranny of choice. The restaurant was instantly called by its meat name not its geographical one: LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰te. Lines formed and have been there ever since even as the family has broken into parts and opened slightly different franchise versions of the restaurant all over the world.There is no queue yet at the New York outpost of LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰te though like the others it takes no reservations. The room is too large perhaps for the neighborhoodÍ¢‘„‘Žs large transient market. But business has been growing. The plural of anecdote is not data but visits over the past eight weeks have seen a more crowded dining room each time. &amp;quot;ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs getting better&amp;quot; a waitress said one recent night. &amp;quot;ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs building.&amp;quot;That is grand. Customers enter the room a brightly colored rectangle near Lexington and 52nd and it spreads south and west before them. Not very good paintings of Venetian scenes adorn the walls in that peculiar French manner that combines bad taste with deep sophistication. Banquettes line the place with pockets of bistro tables set tightly between them everything slightly smaller than it would be in a restaurant owned by Americans.A matron seats you and before you know it a waitress is there to tell you whatÍ¢‘„‘Žs what. &amp;quot;What temperature would you like your steak?&amp;quot; she asks with the friendly slightly bored cadence of a diner waitress or school nurse. (There are no men in LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰teÍ¢‘„‘Žs universe at least in the dining room.) You could be out of the place in 20 minutes if you like.Resist the alacrity with which this woman attends you. Diners may not have much choice in the matter of what they eat but they can throw a brake on the speed with which they get it. So have a cocktail to start insisting that you will order food only when youÍ¢‘„‘Žve had it. (Ordering food as you order a drink mostly leads to the salad arriving before the martini. This is a distressing state of affairs and should be avoided.) The glasses are proper-sized which is to say they are not those giant tureens you find throughout the meatpacking district and thus they encourage rather than inhibit good eating.You might also have wine. You should with the steak anyway which will be here soon enough. As it has been since the start ChÍ—‘¢teau de Saurs is the bottle of choice a cheap Bordeaux that the fancies might call plonk but which drinks well with the meal.Speaking of which here again is the waitress now bearing salads. (See? ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs no build of anticipation to this place at all. Order a drink and: Dinner is on!) It is a pile the size of a softball mixed green and red lettuces draped in a mustardy vinaigrette that in early days here was nearly as thick as a mayonnaise. Lately it has thinned out into something closer to silk. Walnuts are strewn across the top rich and oily. It all goes fast leaving smiles.Your steak comes in two stages on a relatively small plate: you eat your portion of meat sauce and fries and then are served seconds. The beef is fine sliced thin across the grain and as tender as cheap meat gets a perfect midweek dinner with a friend. The fries rate higher on the crazy-good scale: salty and crisp with tender interiors that arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt mushy even when soaked in the sauce.On the subject of that sauce much has been written. Little is known. To its credit the restaurant keeps the ingredients secret. It is perhaps a variant on the gravy poured out at CafÍ—‘© de Paris in Geneva since the 1940s: butter basically infused with herbs and mustard and cream with a metallic tang of chicken liver running right through its middle. Whatever it is at LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰te you could pour the stuff over a boot and still have an excellent dinner.Would you like some more? Those seconds are kept warm on racks that sit above votive candles at service stations set throughout the dining room. The image that this presents of women in uniform standing over dark wood and marble moving platters of rosy steak and golden fries around over twinkling lights is beautiful and slightly moving. It recalls a Manet painting. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs the bar of the Folies-BergÍ—‘Îre minus the dÍ—‘©colletage.Viewed another way it is SchrafftÍ¢‘„‘Žs seen through a Parisian glass a chaste Playboy cartoon. LÍ¢‘„‘ŽEntrecÍ—‘‰te though new to Manhattan has a slightly nostalgic air. In part thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs because of the costumes and the room.But it is also the food which recalls an era of silver plate and good manners the simplicity of salad steak and fries heavy on the salt and butter rich as a cardiologist. (Pass on dessert fridge-cold.) You can find better meat elsewhere of course but such satisfaction as youÍ¢‘„‘Žll find in a meal here is rarer by far. Saltie,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,A tiny sandwich shop where breads are baked in-house and the dessert case is filled with 10 or more different pastries. Saltie is a collaboration among Rebecca Collerton Caroline Fidanza and Elizabeth Schula three veterans of Marlow &amp; Sons and Diner. It's a lot of talent for one cramped kitchen. So they overachieve. The savory sandwiches which change periodically are careful compositions of bright and brawny flavors.Marea,New York,Midtown,The latest jewel in the crown of Chris Cannon and chef Michael White whose Alto and Convivio bracket northern and southern Italian cuisine respectively Marea opened in the space formerly occupied by San Domenico on Central Park South. The restaurant has a menu probably best described as coastal. It is inspired by the sea but by no means is in thrall to it. Eat sea urchin draped in lardo then against an elegant background of gilded conch shells and rosewood walls and follow with fusilli and braised octopus with a sauce made silky with bone marrow. Dover sole by the pound needs no more than a dainty lemon sauce. ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žll be a sprightly affogato for dessert coffee and amaro mixing with zabaglione ice cream. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs luxury. Cowgirl SeaHorse,New York,Financial District,Cowgirl Hall of Fame in the West Village now known simply as Cowgirl is mother to Cowgirl SeaHorse in the financial district. Father is the memory of city roadhouses long gone. Like the Hall of Fame SeaHorse is open and fun Í¢‘„‘î and a house margarita paired with warm salty tortilla chips does much to recall the freak flagship's mood of tolerance. Have a roasted jalapeÍ—‘±o stuffed with shrimp wrapped in bacon. Eat some chicken wings. In a different part of America the baby back ribs would mark the place as one of your better chain restaurants. Here they're just overdone and over-sauced and therefore almost addictive. DBGB Kitchen and Bar,New York,East Village,Just a mosh pit's distance from the birthplace of American punk rock Daniel Boulud tries downtown on for size with a casually elegant sausage and burger bar that offers great French pleasures alongside the ground meat. Designed with the neighborhood's past as a restaurant-supply district in mind DBGB (the name is a play on CBGB the rock club up the street that closed in 2006) offers wonderful sausages from around the world a full international roster of beers on tap and in the bottle and excellent sticky bits from veal tongues to pig trotters. You can reserve in the main dining room or simply dive into an open chair in the bar but either way leave room for an ice-cream sundae or baked Alaska for dessert? Life during wartime! LukeÍ¢‘„‘Žs Lobster,New York,East Village,Straight from the Gulf of Maine to your little paper takeout box the lobster Jonah crab and shrimp in the rolls at this teensy spot in the East Village are bracingly fresh served piled high on top-sliced rolls with few embellishments. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs the purest Down East flavor the city has to offer.EngelineÍ¢‘„‘Žs Restaurant and Bakeshop,Woodside,Woodside,You may find your table crowded with platters of pork at EngelineÍ¢‘„‘Žs Restaurant and Bakeshop one of New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs few outposts of Filipino cooking. Located under the No. 7 train in Woodside Queens it seems to cater primarily to local Filipinos. The pork dishes stand out but there are non-porcine options on the menu too. Recommended dishes: sizzling sisig finely chopped pork belly and raw onions served on a hot cast-iron plate with an egg freshly broken on top; tokwa at baboy deep-fried pig ears with tofu; crispy pata deep-fried pig hoof; chicken adobo; laing taro leaves in coconut milk with shrimp and ground pork; pancit bihon; Bicol express.Bark Hot Dogs,Brooklyn,Park Slope North,Bark Hot Dogs takes a fearless leap into the ever-closing gap between artisan chic and fast food. The hot dogs which start at $4 and come in a well-griddled top-loading bun a pleasant size too small are from Hartmann's Old World Sausage in the Finger Lakes. They are quite good with just a squirt of spicy brown mustard and mild house-made sauerkraut or a refreshing mound of cabbage slaw. You'll need a fork to eat the fries covered in a ladle of smooth white cheddar sauce. On weekends those eating breakfast are rewarded with house-baked biscuits and nuggets of hash browns so crisp outside and fluffy inside that they put those of every other fast-food restaurant to shame. Joseph Leonard,New York,West Village,Gabriel Stulman has named his restaurant after his grandfathers Joseph and Leonard whose portraits hang in vintage frames. The tables are set with cut-glass salt cellars and curlicued flatware. All these weathered surfaces give the 31-seat restaurant a gaslit glow. The kitchen was not always able to fulfill the menu's promises. But flashes here and there Í¢‘„‘î a pork hock so rich and concentrated it could pass for confit for example Í¢‘„‘î suggest that Joseph Leonard may become as adept at feeding its Greenwich Village neighbors as it has been at gauging their taste in antiques. The Standard Grill,New York,West Village,The Standard Grill is not the place to study the latest contortions of the yoga masters of haute cuisine. But it is exactly the place for anybody who needs to recharge by plugging straight into the abundant renewable energy source that is downtown Manhattan. Windows in the dining room look north and south taking in the steel underbelly of the High Line and the endless human circus of the walkers drawn to it. With 200 seats indoors and another 85 on the sidewalk it is a marvel that Dan SilvermanÍ¢‘„‘Žs kitchen reliably bangs out solid flavorful food that casually integrates Spanish ingredients with French and Italian ideas. The service is frequently wobbly and the place is full of small oddities like the very good chocolate mousse you are meant to eat with big rubber spatulas. But against the odds it all adds up to a worthwhile restaurant.M &amp; T Restaurant,Flushing,Flushing,The Chinese city of Qingdao (also spelled Tsingtao) is better known for beer than cooking. But the food at M &amp; T Restaurant a Qingdao spot in Flushing Queens has a simplicity that can be elegant. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs small with about the same square footage and hard lighting as a nail salon but the menu is impressively long. And mostly unfamiliar: the best thing to do is jump in.Calexico Carne Asada,Brooklyn,Columbia Street Waterfront District,The sibling of the Vendy award-winning street cart this Carroll Gardens taqueria serves a carne asada quesadilla that has a punch of flavor so intense itÍ¢‘„‘Žs hard to justify ordering anything else. OMG Taco ,Brooklyn,Cobble Hill,At Oaxaca named for Mexico's cultural and culinary capital the tacos are almost daintily composed. They are built on doubled soft corn tortillas Í¢‘„‘î a small but crucial detail for taco aficionados Í¢‘„‘î and iceberg lettuce and processed cheese are shunned. They taste fresh and light bolstering the menu's declaration of fealty to organic produce and all-natural meats. Squeeze in at the long counter or perch by the front door on a wooden bench facing low cube tables. Recommended dishes: carnitas (braised pork) and camarÍ—‘_n (stewed shrimp) in tacos and rolled tacos. The Redhead,New York,East Village,A bar that evolved into a restaurant the Redhead is a tribute to the gumption of its three proprietors including the talented chef Meg Grace and a sign of these times when distinctive food can be found in unlikely settings and when its East Village neighborhood has become a real culinary center of gravity. The cooking is Southern-inflected and focused on seasonal ingredients comfort foods and familiar fare done with unfamiliar luster: chips and onion dip; a soft pretzel with beer cheese; buttermilk fried chicken. The shrimp with grits is particularly fine the homey desserts are of piece with what precedes them the cocktails are carefully mixed. Be prepared for long waits for tables and get ready for some frenzy and chaos with the missteps that can entail.Saraghina,Brooklyn,Bedford Stuyvesant,Saraghina in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn is a restaurant in pizzeriaÍ¢‘„‘Žs clothing. With winning dishes like bluefish ragu this trattoria is a pretty and unexpected addition to the neighborhood. Seek out the specials an appealing selection of salads antipasti pastas and seafood dishes that change daily. ItÍ¢‘„‘Žs home cooking or at least the kind of uncomplicated food some stylish Italians might throw together at their weekend house.Union Square Cafe,New York,Union Square,Union Square CafÍ—‘©'s determination to take the airs out of fine dining and put its customers at a special kind of ease was unusual when it opened in 1985 and it's remarkable even today. I can't think of another New York restaurant that enjoys such acclaim basks in such adoration and yet exhibits such humility. But in late 2009 as it closed in on the quarter century mark its performance wasn't quite keeping pace with its favor and the transcendent geniality of its atmosphere couldn't obscure moment-to-moment lapses in service and in cooking. At least the restaurant still aced many of its Italian dishes well still had some of the city's best fried calamari maintained a top-notch wine list and continued to boast crowd-pleasing deserts like the famous banana tart with macadamia brittle.Laut,New York,Union Square,Hiding behind a pan-Asian menu is some of the best Malaysian food in Manhattan like Hainanese chicken made with roasted chicken.Cachapas y Mas,New York,Inwood,Cachapas y Mas is a narrow storefront with two high-backed booths a window-side counter and a flat-screen TV that favors music and sports. Just as in the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo fried green plantains replace the bread in sandwiches like the patacÍ—‘_n de pernil loaded with luscious roast pork and adorned with the house-made pink sauce Í¢‘„‘î white dressing with parsley cilantro onion garlic and celery inflamed with bright red hot sauce.El Cocotero,New York,Chelsea,For a patacÍ—‘_n Maracucho (the Venezuelan sandwich in which fried green plantains replace bread) in a full-service setting Í¢‘„‘î perhaps with a glass of beer wine or sangria before lolling against a banquette while listening to gentle Latin tunes Í¢‘„‘î the city's sole option may be El Cocotero. A kitchen that turns out full-blown entrees also shows its hand in patacÍ—‘_n fillings like asado negro pot roast in a sweet onion-and-red-wine sauce. Of course there are arepas the familiar corn patties and a side of plantains is never far away. Minetta Tavern,New York,Greenwich Village,In taking over and freshening up Minetta Tavern a musty Greenwich Village institution dating to the late 1930s Keith McNally did as expected getting the period details right figuring out what to buff and what to leave be. But in collaboration with the chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson he did something unexpected as well: he fashioned the best steakhouse in the city. The dry-aged cÍ—‘‰te de boeuf for two and bone-in New York strip steak -- both from Black Angus cattle at Creekstone Farms -- are among the city's most flavorful and sagely cooked pieces of beef and they're supported here by a menu whose versatility stands in contrast with those of other squarer steakhouses. Yes Minetta is swarmed cramped and loud but there's no arguing with the quality of most of the food which is priced more reasonably than it need be. Skip dessert and have a side of potatoes Anna instead.Juventino ,Brooklyn,Park Slope,After a year of takeout with prepped ready-to-cook ingredients this spot began offering table service for breakfast lunch brunch and dinner. An Choi,New York,Lower East Side,An Choi offers the culinary thrill of Vietnamese streetside dining and the camaraderie of a Lower East Side hangout. The restaurant's low-lighted alleylike design inspired by Ho Chi Minh City is greatly enhanced by a good-natured suspension of disbelief; the food more serious-minded is headlined by long-simmered bowls of pho and gratifying banh mi sandwiches.Fishtail by David Burke,New York,Upper East Side,Like many of his similarly successful peers David Burke is as much showman as chef though he's a particular kind of showman happy to act the clown eager to play the prankster. Like many of his similarly successful peers David Burke is as much showman as chef though he's a particular kind of showman happy to act the clown eager to play the prankster. At Fishtail by David Burke in a fetching Upper East Side townhouse he concentrates that exuberance on seafood which can't always stand up to his approach and ablutions. There are overworked dishes and appealing ones in almost equal measure. The latter better category includes the angry mussels the Dover sole and some of the nightly specials which tend not to be as aggressively sauced. There are overworked dishes and appealing ones in almost equal measure. The latter better category includes the angry mussels the Dover sole and some of the nightly specials which tend not to be as aggressively sauced.Joe &amp; Misses Doe,New York,East Village,Eclectic influences from Asian to Jewish are combined at this 27-seat New American restaurant in dishes like scallops cured in VeeV the liqueur and the signature liver-and-bacon sandwich the Conflicted Jew. Artisanal cocktails including ones made with beer are particularly inspired.Inakaya ,New York,Times Square Theatre District,This Japanese restaurant is a branch of one in Tokyo. It specializes in robata or grill cooking done at the central counter accompanied by exuberant shouts by the staff. The restaurant also serves sushi and other dishes. La Fonda del Sol,New York,Midtown East,Billed as a revival of a 1960 restaurant that brought Spanish cooking to New Yorkers before they were quite ready for it La Fonda del Sol is really an entirely new productionÍ¢‘„‘îand an impressive one at that. Adam TihanyÍ¢‘„‘Žs firm designed a two-part two-tiered space one a festive tapas lounge the other a hushed dining room. In each the food coming out of a kitchen run by Josh DeChellis is surely executed and more often than not very appealing. The front which I preferred is for tuna tacos patatas bravas and toasted bread slathered with tomato and olive oil. The back is for oxtail soup and lamb with a pumpkin seed crust.Txikito,New York,Chelsea,The talented chef Alexandra RaijÍ¢‘„‘Žs follow-up to Tia Pol and El Quinto Pino has a much longer and more complicated menu than she attempted in either of those nooks and maybe thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs why the food is more uneven. She and her sous-chef\/husband Eder Montero focus on the Basque region of Spain and the best of the food Í¢‘„‘î including her &amp;quot;crispy and creamy croquettes&amp;quot; and a suckling pig special Í¢‘„‘î is terrific. The room is boxy and dreary though a friendly staff and an accessibly priced Spanish wine list mitigate its effect.Flip,New York,Upper East Side,New York's most comprehensive hamburger restaurant is in the basement of Bloomingdale's where they offer three different beef blends six different buns 12 sauces and eight cheeses. Ordering can be confusing with so many choices but the meat is delicious.Co.,New York,Chelsea,One of the most frequently mobbed and fervently discussed of the city's new artisanal pizza places Co. actually strives and manages to be a relatively complete restaurant. It amplifies and accompanies its eight or so individual-size pies with fine salads first-rate salumi and cheeses and a decent selection of wine and beer. Jim Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery is the man behind the pizzas; he comes from the bread-making side of things and that showed at least during Co.'s first months in pies whose reliably outstanding crusts outshine their hit-and-miss toppings. The room is pretty in a bright simple way and comfortable but the no-reservations policy can mean long waits at dinnertime. Opt for lunch and make sure to get the popeye stracciatella or ham-and-cheese pizzas.Lamazou,New York,Kips Bay,A longtime labor of love by Nancy and Aziz Lamazou who ate their way around the world during Aziz's years as a diplomat this teeny-weeny shop is jam-packed with packaged goods from across the globe and European cheeses that have been caved beneath the New York sidewalk. Along with daily soups and Lebanese specialties the Lamazous also make one heck of a sandwich. Balthazar baguettes and Sullivan Street ciabatta are sturdy vessels for classy combos like black-pepper pate muenster cheese cornichons and butter. Their unique take on egg salad with bits of roquefort mixed in wows loyalists who line up out the door for takeout-only lunches.Jollibee,Queens,Woodside,Jollibee is a Filipino fast-food chain with 600-plus outlets there across Asia and on our own West Coast. The Woodside branch is New York's first and since its mid-February opening expatriates have lined up for a taste of home on weekends waiting as much as an hour just to get in the door. Jollibee is known as the McDonald's of the Philippines and its menu will be familiar to anyone who's passed under the golden arches. Chickenjoy Jollibee's specialty is straightforward fried chicken with moist meat a crispy but not too thick batter and when ordered spicy a dusting of potent chili powder. After a passel of forgettable burgers the menu heads for odder territory. Spaghetti is topped with a sweet hot-dog-and-ham-studded tomato sauce and is frighteningly addictive. Palabok Fiesta is the only recognizably Asian dish: rice noodles in a gummy-but-yummy sauce of fish flakes pork shrimp egg and crumbled chicharron. The signature deep-fried peach-mango pie is crusty intensely fruity and worth the wait.El Papasito,New York,Clinton,At this Dominican restaurant mangu a green plantain mash is served alongside eggs fried salami and fried cheese and smothered in sweet sautÍ—‘©ed onions. The treble tang of the onions tops the plantain's grassy base note. Emporium Brasil,New York,Midtown,Flaky shrimp pies and eggy pao de queijo or cheese bread made with parmesan and sour cassava flour are worthy accompaniments to a shot of espresso if you are starting your day at this Brazilian restaurant. Kibe Í¢‘„‘î  ground beef encased in a fried football-shape patty of minced beef and bulgur shot through with mint Í¢‘„‘î is a toothsome Lebanese export to Brazilian streets. L'Artusi,New York,West Village,At L'Artusi named for a renowned Italian cookbook writer Gabe Thompson and Joe Campanale have moved well beyond the make-your-own bruschetta they serve at dell'Anima. They have gone not only bigger Í¢‘„‘î with nearly 115 seats L'Artusi is more than twice the size of dell'Anima Í¢‘„‘î but also bolder and the uneven results are a lesson in over-extension. If they turned a more skeptical eye to some of Mr. Thompson's inventions edited the menu to about two-thirds its current length and focused harder on the execution of what remained they'd have an excellent restaurant. As it is they have a fitfully enjoyable one.Margon,New York,Times Square Theatre District,Do you despair of finding a cheap carryout restaurant in midtown Manhattan? Try Margon a decidedly shabby aisle-size Cuban restaurant which does a thriving lunchtime business serving huge portions of delicious food at very low prices. Roast fresh ham slices of lean meat suffused with garlic is full of flavor draped over yellow rice and petite black beans or meatier red beans with sweet plantains. Octopus is served cold as thin tender slices in a pungent marinade with olives onions peppers and cucumbers. But roast chicken is a little dry in its dense brown sauce. Margon boils up a batch of avena every couple of days. PurÍ—‘©ed in the blender finished with cinnamon cloves vanilla and lemon zest and then strained avena is oatmeal as a breakfast drink. Try to get it fresh; reheating on the espresso machine can scald the soupy dish.The menu changes every day with specials like tripe and pig's feet oxtail and pot roast generally available twice a week.   Buttermilk Channel,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,With its house-made pickles house-cured bacon house-made charcuterie and house-ground beef for the burger Buttermilk Channel makes clear that it's a restaurant with real standards noteworthy ambition and a definite slavishness to trends. The menu is distinguished by a slight emphasis on comfort food Í¢‘„‘î croquettes of sweet potato and goat cheese; duck meatloaf; buttermilk fried chicken Í¢‘„‘î and by accessible prices with no entree above $22 and big desserts including a blockbuster pecan pie sundae for $7. The kitchen performs unevenly but its best work is quite fine.Bati,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,Bati has a slightly improvised air. But once the food arrives you feel as if  you're on solid ground. The anchor of an Ethiopian meal is injera a flatbread traditionally made from teff a grain indigenous to East Africa. Some restaurants  use other flours but Bati's injera is the real thing dusky in color and springy to the touch. Food is replenished upon request with seconds spooned directly onto your platter. No utensils are provided; instead batons of rolled-up injera for sopping up the stews are brandished by a vigilant Russian waitress like towels at a public bath. Wilfie &amp; Nell,New York,West Village,The food at Wilfie &amp; Nell named for the grandparents of brothers Mark and Simon Gibson two Dubliners who also own Bua in the East Village is resolutely pub fare. The kitchen turns out only a dozen dishes and most cost less that $10 with the simplest food being the most satisfying. Dhaba,New York,Kips Bay,This is the eighth restaurant for the owner Shiva Natarajan and his third in Manhattan. At Dhaba he created a menu with more than 125 items not including the lunch specials. The cuisine tilts toward India's north with a handful of southern dishes and British-style curries to round it out. If you look lost the waiters will gently direct you toward conventional favorites like kebabs and chicken masala. Salumeria Rosi,New York,Upper West Side,Never mind that the neighborhood already has Fairway and ZabarÍ¢‘„‘Žs Cesare Casella is counting on his own edited selection of cheeses and cured meats at a retail counter to tempt those who may have nibbled them in the 35-seat cafe and Italian wine bar appended to the shop.Cafecito Bogota,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,So you think you know arepas? At this Colombian cafe and wine bar these griddled cornmeal patties Í¢‘„‘î typically palm-size sliced and stuffed at Venezuelan sites Í¢‘„‘î are broader flatter piled high with toppings and best approached with knife and fork. Arepas montadas (mounted arepas) are assembled in more than a dozen varieties; by evening they appear in smaller tapas-like portions. Snackers can opt for traditional breads such as a chewy pan de bono or a fluffy almojÍ—‘bana (al-moe-HAH-bah-nah) with coffee or perhaps a tetero: molasses-sweetened hot water capped with steamed milk.Urubamba,Queens,Jackson Heights,The earth-toned interior provides a subdued setting for the often colorful Peruvian fare. Ocopa a cold appetizer of sliced boiled potato is slathered in a creamy huacatay sauce pale minty green with a flavor to match; the milky base of chupe de camarones a shrimp chowder bolstered by potato peas onion and rice is tinted with aji panca chili paste. Ceviche surfaces in several varieties including a combo of lime-marinated shrimp squid octopus and the mild white-fleshed fish called corvina. As pescado a lo macho the corvina is filleted and fried then smothered under shrimp squid and octopus clams and mussels in the shell and a single crab claw. Washing over them all the peppery white wine sauce also takes well to an ample dome of rice. Urubamba is B.Y.O. ($5 corkage per bottle) but a lemony Inca Kola can cool the burn.At Vermilion,New York ,Midtown East,At At Vermilion a glossy Grand Central-area offshoot of a Chicago restaurant flavors are treated carelessly while care is lavished on the interior. Why go to the trouble of installing a waterfall and filling reflecting pools with Gerbera daisies while serving lamb chops burned outside and chewy in the middle and the same dull mango salsa on three different plates? A few concoctions manage to translate the place's ambitions to the plate but mostly it's mystifying.Five Leaves,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,Five Leaves feels both handmade and industrial as if it were built with materials from a salvaged tug. The beauty is in the details: the worn floors the filament lights and lead sinkers above the bar the skim-coated sheets of steel on the walls. It's a restaurant that could get by on looks alone. But despite the modest ambitions and reasonable prices - it's really a small neighborhood spot open daily from 8 a.m to 12:30 a.m. with breakfast served until well into the afternoon - the kitchen taken over recently by Ken Addington turns out unexpectedly refined Australian comfort food. Agnanti,Brooklyn,Park Slope North,Agnanti in Bay Ridge a branch of an Astoria restaurant offers a welcome take on Greek cuisine: embrace the archipelago. Fried pita with olives is from Cyprus fruity fava-bean dip from Santorini light zucchini-and-cheese croquettes from Mykonos. Agnanti's geographical fixation really shines with its Tastes of Constantinople dishes that reflect the Turkish influence on Istanbul's Greek community. Stuffed grape leaves are meatless sweetish and pure; baked lima beans an ideal comfort food. And then there's the rooster Í¢‘„‘î chunks of male chicken in a mild tomato sauce with odd twists of pasta Í¢‘„‘î which may be pan-Greek but is clearly an Agnanti point of pride. Agnanti meals tend to finish with a dessert of little semolina cakes a puddle of thick yogurt and fat marinated raisins. Al Safa,Brooklyn,Bay Ridge,Al Safa an unassuming Lebanese restaurant has wraparound windows revealing a handful of tables and a glass display case of marinating meats. The restaurant would be chilly were it not for Zein Safa the silver-haired owner whose warmth and enthusiasm pervade the space. He takes particular pride in a staggeringly fresh tabbouleh but he should be equally happy with his baba ghanouj mildly smoky and doused with fruity olive oil and his mujadara warm lentils and rice laced with sweet strands of caramelized onion. Kebabs in pita with lettuce tomato pickles sumac-dusted onions and a tart powerful garlic sauce are even better. Shish taouk Í¢‘„‘î grilled chicken Í¢‘„‘î has a wonderful char and the spicy sujuk sausage an addictive earthiness. Almond,New York,Flatiron,Eric Lemonides and Jason Weiner have opened a 170-seat branch of their French bistro in Bridgehampton N.Y. The menu includes duck confit with creamy lentils skate in a lemon-parsley crust and gratin of cardoons with marrow. The rough wood paneling of what had been Jeffrey ChodorowÍ¢‘„‘Žs Borough Food &amp; Drink has been whitewashed and dressed up with French-style wallpaper. Mr. Chodorow still owns the space.The Cacao Bar by MarieBelle,New York,SoHo,The Old World holds sway at MarieBelle where antique glass cases are stocked with tins of cocoa powder. Tucked at the back the Cacao Bar has a &amp;quot;Bar at the Folies-BergÍ—‘Îre&amp;quot; feel: rusted mirrors a teardrop chandelier tiny round tables barely balancing plates of crepes and demitasse cups. While the setting says Paris the hot chocolate is pure Mesoamerican empire. Ranging from 60 to 75 percent cacao it is best made without milk so it is nearly as thick as pudding.The Chocolate Room,Brooklyn,Park Slope,The Chocolate Room in Park Slope Í¢‘„‘î there is a second location in Cobble Hill Í¢‘„‘î is a homespun place with exposed brick and tables clustered along a banquette. So it's a surprise to receive an amuse-bouche. Nothing fussy: just a cube of almond cake in a teaspoon on a micro-saucer awash in chocolate sauce. But it's the first of many thoughtful touches. The banana in the banana split for example is brulÍ—‘©ed. The Mexican hot chocolate is thrillingly dark with a crescendo of spice: on a wintry day solace in a cup. Vosges Haut-Chocolat,New York,SoHo,At this self-consciously glam spot everything is glossy white with a few bursts of purple. Swoopy plastic chairs line a marble-top communal table. &amp;quot;Exotic drinking chocolates&amp;quot; arrive in delicate flutes. Savories on offer include an elf-hat-shaped truffle embedded with taleggio cheese and a chocolate bar studded with bacon an homage to smoke and salt. Korzo,Brooklyn,Greenwood Heights,Eurotrip is the awkward if endearing name of a gastro-bar in Brooklyn's South Slope that serves the neighborhood well. The kitchen serves Mittel-European comfort food in what might be called recession-era portions. Choose from the 20-plus different beers including a handful on tap and a varied range of sausages.Naya Mezze and Grill,New York,Midtown East,New York has never had a Lebanese restaurant like Naya. But it is not only the shiny spaceship-to-SoHo decor that sets it apart. The menu pulls from both Lebanese mezze tradition - long-cooked vegetables pickles kebabs yogurt cheese - and more elaborate home-style dishes. Simple dishes like shrimp in a concentrated spicy tomato sauce with garlic and moudardara the classic Middle Eastern lentil-and-rice dish with threads of buttery caramelized onion are exceptionally balanced.Boqueria SoHo,New York,SoHo,This Boqueria the larger offspring of one in Chelsea is every bit as good as its sire. The handsome room is walled with white oak panels and tiles; there is an open kitchen and as at the original extra-high tables with high stools. The generously portioned patatas bravas is sparked by pimentÍ—‘_n and a roasted garlic aioli; a broad metal pan of baked cauliflower basically masquerades as quiche promiscuously cheesy and hammy. Boqueria plies adventurous waters presenting a whole fried baby sole and accessorizing fillets of line-caught fluke with not only king oyster mushrooms but also crosnes.Congee Bowery,New York,Lower East Side,The menu is so exhaustive it's exhausting. I followed a friend's advice and ordered House Special Chicken a whole roast chicken for two splayed open varnished with soy sauce crisp and succulent. It sounds familiar but it tastes unusually lively. Even snow pea shoots with garlic so often stringy arrive in a generous leafy mound.Corton,New York,TriBeCa,At Corton Paul Liebrandt finds the sweet spot between disciplined cooking and intricate imaginative leaps. Intricacy and imagination are still there: in a simultaneously ethereal and earthy 'risotto' that floats a white cloud of salt cod foam over a dark terrain of black trumpet mushrooms and riso pasta; in an 'olive sponge' canapÍ—‘© both lighter in weight and more intense in olive flavor than the laws of physics and gastronomy would seem to permit; in a seaweed butter served with the bread that called to mind caviar in a whole new guise. But these exertions aren't obvious or showy. They're a generous attempt to orchestrate a varied medley of tastes both more and less familiar.Pio Pio Salon,New York,Upper West Side,The trademark chicken has an addictively tangy note and it arrives with a spicy sauce made from cilantro lime and huacatay an Andean mint; it would be a bargain at twice the price. Add sides of rice and maduros sweet plantains and it's an avalanche of food. But you should still start with ceviche Lima style tender marinated corvina a kind of bass. And order a round of frothy pisco sours the most authentic Peruvian version I've found in New York. Village Yokocho,New York,East Village,The bilingual menu features six pages of yakitori kushiage (breaded and fried bites) broiled seafood and other small plates most meant for sharing. Raw squid tossed in spicy chili paste could get things going followed by a five-skewer yakitori combo and a languorous bowl of nabeyaki udon a wintry soup filled with chicken fish cakes and an egg that poaches in the broth. I wish there was a better shorthand for this kind of grazing than &amp;quot;tapas&amp;quot; but that's the word Village Yokocho uses.Momofuku Ssam Bar,New York,East Village,David Chang keeps demanding more from himself and his restaurants keeps giving us reasons not to stray. At freewheeling Ssam you can drop in for just 30 minutes have a snack of one or two small dishes pay just $20 for them. And yet the quality of the food Í¢‘„‘î its fastidious sourcing vibrant seasoning and ingenious grace notes Í¢‘„‘î isn't dumbed down in the least for an informal context. Mr. Chang trusts diners not to be disoriented by an assortment of dishes without any instantly clear theme or overriding ethnic allegiance Í¢‘„‘î by platters of artisanal American hams next to a tangle of Sichuan-style beef tendon alongside a hanger steak with a romesco sauce. He pulls off this eclecticism which could easily lapse into incoherence by keeping the menu sufficiently succinct and making sure everything on it counts.Pranna,New York,Midtown South,What is Pranna exactly? A vast nightclub and party space where dinner just happens to be an option? Or a serious Southeast Asian restaurant trapped in a gilded maze that can accommodate more than 400 guests? According to its Web site much of the menu was the outgrowth of eating that the chef Chai Trivedi did while traveling Í¢‘„‘î often on motorcycle Í¢‘„‘î through Thailand Vietnam India and other countries in that part of the world. But neither fuel nor a helmet nor a passport would seem to be prerequisites for the preparation of unimaginative entrees like stir-fried chicken and a rib-eye for two. More impressive though gimmicky is the restaurant's trademark assortment of satays skewered meats and fishes presented with a variety of dipping sauces including sour mandarin galangal and sweet lemongrass caramel. El Tesoro,Brooklyn,Sunset Park,The seafood fried rice called chaulafan is an Ecuadorean take on a Chinese standard so while the plate of shrimp egg peas tomato pork and beef is heavily tinged with soy sauce it's also studded with Ecuadorean black clam and sided with fried plantain. There's an orange hot sauce that glows only a little less than the neon bar signs. Morocho hot milk spiked with cinnamon has a white-corn payload at the bottom of the glass.Kanoyama,New York,East Village,Opened under a different name in the East Village in early 2004 Kanoyama has justly become a go-to place for sushi savants who are willing to trade away some atmosphere for top-flight fish at less-than-stratospheric prices. It's cramped. Service is slow. But the breadth of the selection of sushi and sashimi is thrilling and adventurous eaters will find items not presented in many other sushi restaurants. An omakase at the counter can be expensive but combination sushi and sashimi platters at the tables are a real bargain.Porchetta,New York,East Village,They beckon from the counter in their Henny Penny warmer with their come-hither glisten and porcine perfume. Pork loin wrapped in pork belly with fennel pollen garlic sage rosemary and fistfuls of salt and pepper roasted for five hours in a combi oven that has locked in their moisture.Wanting nothing but slicing onto Sullivan Street Bakery rolls these bundles have been known to make sandwich-lovers swoon.The chef Sara Jenkins is already saying she'll become bored with this strict pork diet and in the weeks she's been open she's experimented with expanding her eight-item menu running specials like parsnip soup.But patrons of her tiny East Village shop won't be fatigued by its namesake. The porchetta is too multifaceted all by itself. In central Italy where the dish originated they roast the entire pig.Here it only tastes as if you're eating the whole Hampshire beast. Tender loin mingles with dark-streaked belly and bits of skin which are as tacky as taffy on one side and so crunchy on the other that they pose a chewing hazard. It's a texture adventure.The sweet yin of the pollen and the yang of the salt simply boost its natural flavor.This is a small sandwich for the price but the pork is so extravagant it's just big enough. If you must make a pig of yourself get a side of potatoes; they're crisped in a roasting pan with leftover bits of the good stuff. Sushi Azabu,New York,TriBeCa,Sushi Azabu stands out in a crowded sushi marketplace on account of its sublime setting: an unmarked subterranean lair within and beneath a multi-ethnic restaurant in TriBeCa called the Greenwich Grill. While the quality of both the raw fish and the cooked dishes is erratic the sushi and sashimi here is hardly run-of-the-mill and a fine selection of it can be sampled in prix fixe meals that are reasonably priced for this kind of restaurant and for this kind of coddling service.Candle 79,New York,Upper East Side,One of the most beloved and ambitious vegan restaurants in New York Candle 79 doesn't quite make you forget that meat fish dairy and eggs aren't coming to the party. But it proves that you can have a festive enough time without them. It stretches over two comfortable floors of a spacious townhouse. Its hummus seasoned with smoked paprika is terrific and in some dishes it uses seitan a wheat gluten as a fairly deft mimic of meat: the seitan piccata bright with lemon and salty with capers is a minor revelation. Chocolate desserts could pass muster in a restaurant operating with fewer restraints and there's a list of interesting wines and beers affordably priced as is the food. No. 7,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,No. 7 is a comfortable restaurant with comfortable prices but it is not doing comfort food. It is doing big-city night-on-the-town chef food sophisticated assemblages like slices of rare tuna fanned out with crisp almost sweet Asian pear. This appetizer looks utterly cool and composed its rosy pink fish set off by the creamy white pear. But a shower of jalapeÍ—‘±o oil knocks it off balance and starts a battle for dominance Í¢‘„‘î hot? cold? Í¢‘„‘î that happily is never quite resolved. No new ground is broken here but the dish has a low-key tension thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs engaging and characteristic of the approach taken by the chef Tyler Kord. He does not land everything he launches. But the expertly cooked hanger steak with spicy kimchi pirogis overachieves and the banana pudding that should end your meal also ends any quibbles about No. 7. Socarrat Paella Bar,New York,Chelsea,In many ways Socarrat is a modest endeavor with severe limitations. It has just 24 seats all of them stools and all but four of those at a two-sided communal table without much elbow room. Its wine list is short it doesn't take reservations and people angling for stools have nowhere comfortable to wait. But where paella is concerned Socarrat's vision is expansive. It serves eight kinds: a classic paella with rabbit and snails; a paella with seafood but not meat; a paella with meat but not seafood; a vegetarian paella; a paella using a thin noodles in lieu of rice. These paella's aren't perfect but they're better than most paella around town and then nail that sticky crunchy bottom layer of rice the socarrat that gives the restaurant its name. A half dozen desserts and 20 tapas are also on hand but paella's the star. Apiary,New York,East Village,As befits a restaurant owned by a furniture company Apiary has snazzy chairs. Fetching tables too. Nut the food doesn't exert as seductive a claim to the diner's attention as the furniture. The company is Ligne Roset those Gallic mavens of sleek minimalism branching out here from ottomans to heirloom tomatoes. It is a co-owner of the restaurant with Jenny Moon who worked at Daniel and Tabla. Scott Bryan who was the chef at Veritas then moved to Virginia has returned to New York to be the executive chef replacing Neil Manacle.Delicatessen,New York,Nolita,Delicatessen may not be particularly good but it's smart and it understands its audience. To wit: the cheeseburger spring roll. It's one of this sleek cheeky-named downtown restaurant's most popular appetizers and most fitting inventions a tidy wedding of comfort food and trendy Asian canape. And it's emblematic of a place that gives hungry budget-conscious booze-filled young New Yorkers a menu and a setting that are totally approachable but have a glimmer of sophistication. Some dishes Í¢‘„‘î Reuben fritters a blintz with Nutella and banana Í¢‘„‘î tweak deli classics. Others like the juicy crunchy fried chicken just provide gut-busting nourishments. Salads and such give the waistline obsessives a way out. Yerba Buena,New York,East Village,The menu floats across national borders and it feels as if the kitchen is still finding its footing. Some dishes live up to their billing like the luscious suckling pig with yucca puree but others miss like the under-seasoned grouper. Some do both like the beef short rib. But the cocktail list is a knockout and everything tastes good while sipping a Poquito Picante a citrusy gin drink with cilantro cucumber and jalapeÍ—‘±o. Kai Feng Fu Dumpling House,Brooklyn,Borough Park,In New York shao bing (sesame pancakes) often appear at Beijing-style fried dumpling shops known for their remarkable price-to-quality ratio and their lack of amenities like chairs. But they also make niu rou shao bing an exquisite sandwich on bread that rivals anything from Sullivan Street Bakery or Tom Cat Bakery. Right out of the wok the shao bing are sprinkled with sesame seeds hacked into wedges dabbed with hoisin sauce and stuffed with braised beef. The crunchy sandwich shows off the breadÍ¢‘„‘Žs flaky inside subtle scallion flavor and golden crust. Kai Feng Fu Dumpling House in Sunset Park Brooklyn is one of the best of New YorkÍ¢‘„‘Žs new crowd of specialists in this mian shi meaning flour food Í¢‘„‘î dumplings noodles and bread Í¢‘„‘î a staple of Northern China. Little Morocco,Astoria,Astoria,Little Morocco is a breezy cafe in Astoria Queens on Steinway Street south of the Grand Central Parkway a thoroughfare lined with hookah cafes halal butchers Middle Eastern bakeries and North African restaurants; a mosque across the street provides a steady stream of customers. Paprika-reddened merguez sausages are made daily at the cafe cooked to order and stuffed into crusty grilled &amp;quot;petit pain&amp;quot; Í¢‘„‘î &amp;quot;little bread&amp;quot; in Casablanca a k a Italian rolls in Queens Í¢‘„‘î with cubes of cucumber and tomato chopped green olives and a hot-pink spicy garlicky harissa also made in-house. Wine vinegar and extra oil emulsify the harissa into a tangy sandwich spread that takes a bow toward mayonnaise. Taim,New York,West Village,To make a great falafel sandwich with its many components -- hot and cool crunchy and soft spicy and smooth -- is exacting. Taim's version is transformed by the fresh herbs that go into the dough: typically a golden mass of chickpeas but bright green here from quantities of cilantro parsley and mint. That breath of fresh herbs along with the crunch of the hot crust and the earthy cream of the tahini pulls the Taim falafel to the front of the pack.Rusty Knot,New York,West Village,The Rusty Knot is downtown decorated in a shabby-chic vein and connected by ownership to the Spotted Pig and Freemans. But itÍ¢‘„‘Žs not putting a falsely modest skin over a soul of discernment. It takes its lack of pretension seriously which is no doubt oxymoronic and the very essence of its charm. On the jukebox you find songs like HeartÍ¢‘„‘Žs &amp;quot;Little Queen.&amp;quot; Only four booths none of which can be reserved accommodate 16 people at most. Otherwise itÍ¢‘„‘Žs scattered stools and armchairs and the fish tank. But the food is the giveaway: there are smidgens of ambition and vanity at work. A hot dog is cradled by a delectable spiral of soft pretzel instead of a roll; peel-and-eat shrimp tucked into a plastic basket and doused with Old Bay are tender. Most people arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt eating though. TheyÍ¢‘„‘Žre drinking as they watch the sun set over the Hudson just across the West Side Highway and so close you can imagine someone pulling up to the Rusty Knot in a boat. Mas,New York,West Village,Even as it ages the West Village restaurant Mas which evokes a French farmhouse (but with a decidedly Manhattan sheen) still feels every bit as attentive eager and earnest as it did when it opened in March 2004. In fact it has used age to its advantage: its talented chef Galen Zamarra makes better decisions and his kitchen operates with more diligence than in the past. Here you'll find intricately wrought dishes that incorporate French influences and reflect the season. You'll find a menu that changes as quickly as any other around town. You'll more fine-restaurant flourishes-- a serious wine list a serious cheese list -- than at other niches of this relatively modest scale. Mas isn't quite as reliable as a restaurant of its considerable expense should be but it's usually a sweet happy getaway.Nizza,New York,Clinton,Nizza which uses the Italian name for the French city of Nice offers a wide variety of salads pizzas that arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt destination fare but are easy to scarf and a selection of main courses that are filling enough to get you through a four-act play. But the best approach is snacking: a plate of salumi; an order or two of excellent socca the savory pancake made from chickpea flour thatÍ¢‘„‘Žs a regional staple; and the creamy-crisp chickpea fries called panisse. Sookk,New York,Upper West Side,Interesting if unsteady food makes Sookk an exception to the increasingly charmless Thai restaurants of Manhattan. It sets out to introduce New Yorkers to a very specific strand of Bangkok street food: that of Yaowarat Road the central thoroughfare of BangkokÍ¢‘„‘Žs Chinatown which is lined with the stalls of Chinese herbalists. The word &amp;quot;herbs&amp;quot; signals the best food on the long menu: Yaowarat herbs stewed beef soup is a deeply spiced rounded beefy broth poured over crunchy mouthfuls of bean sprouts and cilantro; herbal cinnamon duck is an aromatic clay-pot braise with mushrooms red dates and ginkgo nuts. Tables are tiny every plate is oddly shaped and about three times too large. Constant shuffling results. La SirÍ—‘Îne,New York,SoHo,It's important not to oversell the eccentric little bistro La SirÍ—‘Îne which operates on a shoestring doesn't have a liquor license and doesn't ace many of the dishes on its relatively short French menu. The escargot covered in buttery bread crumbs is better than the beet salad doused with too much truffle oil. The gooey dark chocolate cake outshines the wispy chocolate mousse. But this minimally decorated cramped 25-seater by the Holland Tunnel provides a warm change of pace from the vacuous polish and higher prices of better-known establishments. Its chef a transplanted Frenchman named Didier Pawliki is more dedicated than most of his better-known peers. Plus he does memorable cassoulet and profiteroles. Order those watch him ping around the restaurant and just try not to smile.Bar Boulud,New York,Upper West Side,Continuing a trajectory of ever-more-casual restaurants Daniel Boulud has made Bar Boulud which opened at the start of 2008 a place where many of the seats are at a long counter walk-in business is encouraged and the star attractions aren't the entrees. They're the fantastic charcuterie selections --- terrines pates sausages --- and a terrific wine list that emphasizes Burgundy and the Rhone and has many fine options below $75 a bottle. A more conventional three-course meal can be had and it can be quite good but that's not the best use of Bar Boulud strategically positioned just opposite Lincoln Center the better to pick off members of the artsy herd stampeding into and out of performances. Word to the wise: go at lunchtime and have the Croque Monsieur. It's a sandwich with delusions of quiche-ness. Grand Tier Restaurant,New York,Upper West Side,Umberto Montano exported the modern Florentine menu of his restaurant Alle Murate which is in a 14th-century frescoed palace in Florence Italy. Jeff Raider is his executive chef.Dovetail,New York,Upper West Side,On a patch of the Upper West Side with an unreliable appetite for adventurous and somewhat fussy dining the chef John Fraser has opened a restaurant that delivers precisely that experience and the packed dining room on a blustery weeknight was a testament to how well he pulls it off. He and his pastry chef Vera Tong cook with intellect and wit but they seldom get too cerebral too cute. His pork-belly-and-egg dish is breakfast as an appetizer only at breakfast the belly is smoked and called bacon. Her brioche bread pudding with bacon brittle is breakfast as dessert only at breakfast the bread is called French toast. And so it goes at this warm intriguing restaurant with a brown palette exposed brick and bare wood tables that balance out the ambition of the food. Gazala Place,New York,Clinton,At Gazala Place the best way to get a taste of Druse cuisine is to order a platter of appetizers for the table and share it. The menu is similar to many Middle Eastern places but there are slight differences; for example instead of serving pita bread Gazala Halabi grills saag. It's thinner than a crepe as wide as a small pizza and pliable like lavash.Second Avenue Deli,New York,Kips Bay,The Second Avenue Deli's pastrami is borscht red and tender. The chicken soup brims with fresh dill. And the matzoh brei is the epitome of breakfast comfort. But in the end the Second Avenue Deli reborn on East 33rd Street near Third Avenue isn't about a lineup of Jewish deli classics that please and a lineup of other classics (the latke the chopped liver) that disappoint. It's about the sport of friendly bickering over proper seasoning correct condiments corned beef versus tongue. It's about nostalgia. To eat here is to pass through a communal storehouse of memories on a bridge of babkas from the past to the future. Soba Totto,New York,Midtown East,Soba Totto boasts a number of qualities that have come to mark Ryuichi Munekata's restaurants: a kitchen overseen by Mika Ohie that executes its duties with precision and consistency; a menu where unvarnished classics and more offbeat dishes mingle; service that is gracious and accommodating and just languid enough to give you time to polish off your drink and order another. Ilili,New York,NoMad,In terms of setting Ilili is probably the grandest excursion into Middle Eastern cooking that New York has seen its 300-plus seats distributed through rooms with high ceilings and an amber-glowing dÍ—‘©cor. And so foie gras wagyu beef and raw bluefin tuna are on the menu in accordance with the current dictates for taking a medium-profile cuisine into the big time and charging a high price for it. The specific geographic point of reference is Lebanon though the chef Philippe Massoud brings other countries of the Mediterranean into play as well. He does terrific work with grilled meats and with the classics: falafel tabouleh and the like. His more playful and creative dishes Í¢‘„‘î duck schwarma anyone? Í¢‘„‘î arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt as reliable. Amber,New York,Upper West Side,Asian fusion found a home on the Upper West Side when Amber opened as a casual space offering Japanese Chinese and Thai specialties. A cocktail lounge and sushi bar takes up the front of the restaurant and the back dining room's exposed brick wall is lined with Asian art. They typical Asian dishes like curry and special sushi rolls fill a mostly affordable menu.Hakata Tonton,New York,West Village,There's just one catch at Hakata Tonton a restaurant where the portions arenÍ¢‘„‘Žt Lilliputian and the staff is friendly: nearly all the dishes save the sweets incorporate Í¢‘„‘î and in most cases glorify Í¢‘„‘î pigsÍ¢‘„‘Ž feet. Those that don't like a pig's ear salad or an order of calf liver sashimi aren't going to do much for those not inclined to eat pigs' feet either. But while some might expect this to be a parlor of extreme eating there isn't a macho vibe at the restaurant; it's quiet even reserved. The place feels honest and genuinely warm even if it is genuinely weird. Bacaro,New York,Lower East Side,A basement on the Lowerest East Side Bacaro Í¢‘„‘î from Frank DeCarlo one of the people behind the NoLIta institution Peasant Í¢‘„‘î serves so-so Italianate dishes and expensive wine. But regardless of the food (all of it under $20) the lure of its dark wood chandeliers marble-top bar upstairs and cozy grotto below is likely to continue to draw in the young and attractive set. Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill,New York,Clinton,Eric and Bruce Bromberg the brothers responsible for the Blue Ribbon brood have brought their bold culinary eclecticism uptown and given it a large-scale setting in the 6 Columbus hotel. With about 115 seats in a series of windowless rooms Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar &amp; Grill isn't their most personal restaurant but it's impressive for the way it juggles and does justice to so many genres and sensibilities at once. Here you can get some of the best fried chicken in town irresistible marrow bones a few terrific steaks (try the strip with miso pepper sauce) and make-it-yourself assembly kits for sushi hand rolls and all of that's under one odds-defying roof. Cooper's Tavern,New York,Midtown West,Cooper's Tavern a handsome restaurant at the New Yorker Hotel presents four hefty cuts with a choice of five sauces allowing for a game of mix-and-match. I tried the rib steak ($35) and the porterhouse for two ($75) sufficiently flavorful and juicy to keep me from mixing and matching. The evening menu includes many salads pasta dishes and main courses of other meats or fish while the lunch menu has a selection of sandwiches. Cooper may not handle all of this terrain as ably as it does its steaks. But the area around Penn Station isn't a culinary wonderland so it could come in handy.Mermaid Inn Uptown,New York,Upper West Side,A reasonably good seafood restaurant in the East Village the Mermaid Inn is a frustratingly mediocre one in its uptown location. A few dishes show signs of life: a savory purÍ—‘©ed fish soup crisp roasted whole fish with chunks of fried potato and parsley. Oysters are reliably good. And the front room is pleasant until the bar fills with the next round of reservations. But skate wing and spaghetti entrees both swam in pools of grease; the seafood platter was tooth-achingly cold giving razor clams the texture of pencil erasers. And what is the point of a fish joint that can't even make likable fried calamari?Barbuto,New York,West Village,The consistency of Barbuto's terrific roasted chicken over the four years since the restaurant opened is so remarkable it's cause for scientific study. It's also cause for befuddlement because so much else about the restaurant including its service is so much less reliable. Even so Barbuto's charms win out in the end. Pasta and gnocchi dishes are usually great thanks to the kitchen's sure hand with hearty ragus and the setting Í¢‘„‘î a former car garage with concrete floors and exterior glass walls that roll up and down Í¢‘„‘î is quintessentially scruffy-chic. Make sure to end any meal with the chocolate budino. TBar Steak and Lounge,New York,Upper East Side,The blue-tinted silver-haired clientele at TBar a rare steak outpost in the neighborhood should find comfort with the menu of mostly well-prepared dishes that do not challenge diners. Its foundation in the '50s has been updated a bit - Treviso gracing one salad broccoli rabe as a side dish. In a dalliance with the 21st century there are Berkshire pork chops and French fries seasoned with smoked paprika. Portions are more than generous. Closer to the bar the volume rose and the age of the diners fell. Attractive well-coiffed and suitably jeweled they were having a grand time. Younger generations found their comfort level too.Cafe Katja,New York,Lower East Side,In Austria buschenschanks are places of simple eating and drinking where farmers can sell as much of anything theyÍ¢‘„‘Žve grown raised fermented preserved or otherwise wrangled from their land before the government assesses taxes on it. The buschenschank Í¢‘„‘î or its spirit conviviality and cuisine Í¢‘„‘î is the inspiration for CafÍ_‘‰ Katja a tiny spot on the Lower East Side with a menu of simple Austrian fare that is downright cheap and an excellent selection of beers wines and schnapps. The menu is dominated by meat pork mostly and it lends itself to snacking. It also begs for good drink and Katja delivers. There are six beers on tap including Schneider hefe-weisse and a well-considered wine list. Radegast Hall and Biergarten,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Radegast Hall and BiergartenÍ¢‘„‘Žs name gets across much of the pertinent information about the place: it serves beer and it is big. How big? Theme restaurant big: 4500 square feet of space is divided between a hall done in dark wood and an indoor beer garden with a high ceiling Í¢‘„‘î the roof panels open up in the summer Í¢‘„‘î that is lined with rough-hewn wooden tables long enough to accommodate 20 people at each. There are 13 varieties on tap Í¢‘„‘î all available by the pint liter and pitcher Í¢‘„‘î and dozens more in bottles with plenty of easy-drinking European selections. When it comes to the food skip the printed menu and make a beeline for the open grill at the back of the beer garden. There youÍ¢‘„‘Žll find a short list of grilled sausages served with your choice of bread or pretty good French fries; the kielbasa that Radegast gets from a nearby Polish butcher is worth a spin.Food Shing,New York,Chinatown,Food Shing (though the awning and menus read Food Sing a printer's error they say) traded in its old digs for a brighter and much bigger space next door on East Broadway at Bowery that's all sunshine and smiles. In place of gritty action on the television that played at the old place there's drippy Chinese pop music its saccharine sentiments interrupted by the slurping around you or the slap-slap-slap of dough being pulled into fresh noodles in the kitchen. Those noodles the restaurant's soup and its prices are good enough to keep you coming back for more even if they no longer come with a side of noir. The meat is better from the oxtails if you're down for working the bones and the other options Í¢‘„‘î agreeably fishy fish balls and roast duck among them Í¢‘„‘î hit their marks. There's nothing to fuss over on the menu no appetizers no side dishes. You point at a soup the waitress writes and hands over a receipt and minutes later there's a meal in front of you. Let it rest for a second lest you scour your tongue clean of taste buds with the boiling hot broth then dig in.Graffiti,New York,East Village,Graffiti Jehangir Mehta's East Village cafe is not wanting for sweetness. Fortunately it's the endearing kind not the sugary overload one might anticipate from a pastry chef-turned-restaurateur. The restaurant serves a short menu of Asian fusion small plates most with an Indian accent. Some of the dishes hit their marks like the unlikely combination of pork dumplings and grapefruit confit. But the flops flop hard like a beef-stuffed sesame pancake sandwich that costs 10 times what one pays for an infinitely better version down at the Dumpling House on Eldridge Street in Chinatown. And the space is comically small and it feels smaller still because of the plush sea of throw pillows and too many chairs. It's too bad: Graffiti's stabs at hospitality would play better on a bigger stage and Mr. Mehta's creative cooking could be more fully realized if it were coming from a full kitchen not a nook the size of a pantry. Kingswood,New York,West Village,In the absence of emu carpaccio and the like how are New Yorkers supposed to peg Kingswood as Australian? Stand around at the bar long enough and a fellow in an Aussie bush hat will eventually lead those with reservations out of the mob. More clues are buried in the menu with its big successful flavor combinations and a cheerful cobbling of ethnic influences: a south Indian monkfish curry here California-style composed salads there. Any remaining questions about Kingswood's identity are dispelled by the patrons who drink tall foamy beers and say things like &amp;quot;You missed Declan's party Saturday night it was brilliant.&amp;quot; Mamajuana Cafe,New York,Inwood,Fun comes easily to some restaurants. Take Mamajuana Cafe a stylish Dominican spot on a breezy stretch of Dyckman Street. On one Tuesday night there were two birthday parties a flamenco trio a news conference for a pop singer and not an empty seat or dour face to be seen in the flattering light. Waiters thread through the crowd holding high plates of puerquito pork shoulder marinated in wine bitter oranges and spices then roasted for 10 hours. It's big enough for a family and the crispy skin has an addictive tang. Familiar Caribbean cooking is given an Inwood polish as in the maduro relleno de bacalao a sweet plantain roasted with the skin on then split and stuffed with spiced salt cod. The namesake mamajuana isn't a coded misspelling it's a blend of rum wine and honey steeped with roots and herbs and was brewed long before Columbus turned up in this hemisphere. It is tempting to linger for a round of that pleasantly sweet and bitter drink. At 10 p.m. the restaurant will just be hitting its stride. Peter Luger Steak House,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Has Peter Luger grown tired of us or have some of us simply grown tired of it? This venerated and venerable New York institution opened in 1887 and visits to the steakhouse around its 120th birthday suggested an inconsistency at odds with its legend. When Peter Luger is on its game the gruffness of its waiters is pitch-perfect Í¢‘„‘î more amiable than obnoxious Í¢‘„‘î and the charred sizzling butter-doused porterhouse is a steak more breathtaking than any in the city. But sometimes the service is just plain chilly and the steak misses its mark and that's when you notice the flaws in other menu items and wonder why you shouldn't just visit one of Luger's rapidly expanding number of clones which are less brutally illuminated more consistently courteous and unlike Luger take credit cards.Southern Hospitality,New York,Upper East Side,The best thing at Justin TimberlakeÍ¢‘„‘Žs new restaurant comes in a box. That would be an order of the baby back ribs ($22.95 for a full slab) to go away from the cacophonous bar and dining room flooded with unflattering light from the barrage of countless flat screen TVÍ¢‘„‘Žs and neon signs and drowned in a booming soundtrack that jumps from Tom PettyÍ¢‘„‘Žs &amp;quot;American Girl&amp;quot; to Michael JacksonÍ¢‘„‘Žs &amp;quot;P.Y.T.&amp;quot; to pre-Hagar Van Halen. With a shrine-like picture of Johnny Cash hanging just feet from a video golf game parked in the middle of a cluster of tables near the bar this place offers many head-scratching juxtapositions. But the most confounding thing about Southern Hospitality is those baby back ribs. Because they are against tall odds good. Beyond the barbecue thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a roster of forgettable if not regrettable sides and a lot of fried food. And even though itÍ¢‘„‘Žs packed to capacity Í¢‘„‘î the staff from the hostess to the waitresses are friendly and accommodating.Go! Go! Curry,New York,Midtown West,Have you been pining for an inexpensive garment district spot that unites all three of those elements? Then rest easy fellow travelers: Go! Go! Curry the first American incursion of a chain peddling Japanese curry Í¢‘„‘î which is nothing like the turmeric-dominated Indian-style stew dishes that most Americans associate with the word &amp;quot;curry&amp;quot; Í¢‘„‘î is the place for you.The menu has a baseball theme: curries are sold in sizes from a walk (small: $5 plain $7 with chicken or pork cutlets shrimp or sausage) to a triple (extra large: $7.50 plain $9.50 with one of the meat options) each extra base meaning more rice more curry sauce and more pieces of the fried protein of your choice will be piled higher on your plate.ThereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a short roster of toppings including processed cheese and natto (an extra-funky fermented soybean product) for $1 to $2 extra though my experience was that the curries were always satisfactorily accessorized. That was especially the case with the Grand Slam ($12.50) Í¢‘„‘î the kitchen sink of the menu Í¢‘„‘î which is the best deal and if for nothing more than the variety it offers the most interesting option for first-timers to pick at.Soto,New York,West Village,After 11 years in Atlanta where he drew national attention as a fastidious craftsman the Japanese chef Sotohiro Kosugi has come to Manhattan. His minimalist theater is in Greenwich Village and it's a showcase for impressive culinary artistry in roughly 30 modestly portioned hot and cold dishes that combine lovely fish and vibrant seasonings in distinctive ways.There's broiled langoustine with a shiitake-flavored mayonnaise geoduck clam salad with spicy radish sprouts and an emphasis on uni used a slavishly here as at any restaurant I've encountered. Be forewarned that service is sluggish and the array of a la carte sushi and sashimi unexceptional. If you confine yourself to that part of the menu you're missing not only the best of Soto but also the adventurous point of it. Franny's,Brooklyn,Park Slope,It would be easy to distrust the restaurant Franny's most ardent fans who tend to live near its Prospect Heights Brooklyn location and can't always explain what makes the cured meats salads and pizzas so special. It would also be wrong. Franny's earnestness along with an emphasis on freshness and seasonality that stands out even in this era of Greenmarket reverence turns a seemingly ordinary menu into a road map to pure pleasure. The menu lengthened in June 2007 to include a lineup of pasta dishes most of them terrific that changes nightly. You may have to wait for your table Í¢‘„‘î no reservations are taken Í¢‘„‘î and you can't trust that you'll love your dessert. But you'll find savory dishes that are at once straightforward and sophisticated in a laid-back setting with a truly diverse crowd. Rayuela,New York,Lower East Side,A beautiful fascinating frustrating place the &amp;quot;freestyle Latino&amp;quot;restaurant Rayuela strives hard to impress. Sometimes it does: a &amp;quot;tuna rellena&amp;quot; that combines Latin American and Asian traditions is a bonanza of flavors and textures. And the outstanding bread shows that the restaurateurs care enough to lavish attention on every part of a meal. But at others times the food is way too busy and there's an emphasis on flashiness that doesn't serve the restaurant as well as juicier meat in the overcooked &amp;quot;crispy pork&amp;quot; or more tender shellfish in an Ecuadorian stew would. Aurora SoHo,New York,SoHo,Exposed brick walls bare wooden tables hardwood floors Í¢‘„‘î rustic is the look Aurora SoHo is aiming for. Unfortunately unadorned also means loud. For those who don't want to use a cellphone to converse with others at their table the din might keep the restaurant an offshoot of Aurora in Williamsburg Brooklyn from being their first choice. But they'd miss an intriguing selection of what the chef Riccardo Buitoni describes as innovative Italian regional cuisine. The dishes are familiar Í¢‘„‘î roasted quail lemon sole Í¢‘„‘î but they have unexpected ingredients that give a sense that you haven't eaten this a million times before. If the menu tempts you despite the noise console yourself with the restaurant's extensive Italian wine list. Or buy earplugs. Benjamin Steak House,New York,Midtown South,At this point Peter Luger can almost be considered the mother of all steakhouses in a literal sense: its beefy children have popped up all around Manhattan over the last three years. Former Luger employees opened Wolfgang's Steakhouse and both Blair Perrone Steakhouse and Benjamin Steak House are the work of onetime members of the Luger brood. You can see Í¢‘„‘î and taste Í¢‘„‘î the Luger family resemblance in Benjamin's juicy sizzling porterhouses sized for two three or four just as they are at Luger. There's a Caesar salad Canadian bacon and creamed spinach all satisfying. Service was somewhat gruff another hereditary trait. But Benjamin departs from many of its steakhouse relatives with its more elegant setting a grand room with a high ceiling brass chandeliers and rich brown leather on the seats. Still brace yourself for the check. The Luger DNA doesn't come cheap. Cafe Boulud,New York,Upper East Side,This is your opportunity to find out what happens when a great chef Í¢‘„‘î Daniel Boulud Í¢‘„‘î stretches out and takes chances. The menu which changes frequently is divided into four sections: La Tradition (classic country cooking) La Saison (seasonal dishes) Le Potager (vegetarian choices) and Le Voyage (world cuisine). What that really means is anything goes. Most days there are 30 or more dishes and none are ordinary. They are all completely delicious. Robert's Steakhouse,New York ,Clinton,At RobertÍ¢‘„‘Žs Steakhouse I got char richness depth and a more pronounced degree of aging an unmistakable tanginess that accentuated and stretched out the beefÍ¢‘„‘Žs flavor. I got it in the bone-in strip steak ($53) the rib-eye for two ($104) and the porterhouse for two ($106). All of these had spent at least 6 and as many as 10 weeks in a special vault where their custodian Adam Perry Lang rigorously controls the humidity and the air flow. The restaurant's atmosphere granted isnÍ¢‘„‘Žt for everyone and it has other shortcomings as well but no matter what your appetite for the saucy spectacle accessorizing these steaks youÍ¢‘„‘Žll be turned on by the quality of the plated meat.Pera Mediterranean Brasserie,New York,Midtown South,Ceramics carpets baths: certain things are done better in Turkey than in many other countries and that list could arguably be led by the marinating seasoning and grilling of meats. Pera which honors the Turkish culinary spirit is proof of that. Its $46 meal of family-style platters of these meats along with tiny Turkish-style pizzas and an array of mezes is a winner though diners who stray to other areas of an uneven menu risk disappointment or at least boredom. The room though is very lively notto mention good-looking like the people in it. Finding something this jazzy in the shadow of Grand Central Terminal is an unexpected delight. Taam-Tov,Manhattan,Midtown,Serving the cuisine of Bukhara in Central Asia Taam-Tov is the best deal on a street where you can end up spending a fortune. Perched two floors above 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues itÍ¢‘„‘Žs smack in the middle of the diamond district. It is a glatt kosher establishment but rarely has a restricted diet tasted as good as it does here. The one must-have among the house specialties is the golubtsy ($6.99) a plate of cabbage leaves stuffed with ground meat and rice in a broth stained red with paprika; as good as stuffed cabbage gets.Gordon Ramsay at the London,New York,Midtown,Disappointed by the reaction to his New York debut in late 2006 the British culinary cyclone named Gordon Ramsay made adjustments. It's less the winds than the subtle breezes of change that have blown into this glossy venture. They represent improvements but much of the expertly prepared food still lacked the glimmers of surprise and sense of real adventure that might have made them as exciting as they were coolly impressive. The restaurant is clearly marshaling first-rate ingredients rolling out the luxuries Í¢‘„‘î several dishes had Perigord truffle Í¢‘„‘î and hiring and training polished servers. I left feeling pampered but wanting something more. Mo Gridder's BBQ,Bronx,Hunts Point - Longwood,Mo Gridder's is a sight to behold: a 35-foot-long fire-engine-red competition-ready barbecue trailer. Tacked onto one end is a Southern Pride 500 barbecue pit a piece of equipment fearsome enough to impress even the most casual rib eater. The menu is expansive much like those at other New York barbecue spots. And much like the food at other New York barbecue spots not everything is magic. But the ribs: that's where the getting gets good. They are St. Louis cut Í¢‘„‘î from the middle of a rack of spareribs Í¢‘„‘î and they are dry-rubbed before a six-hour snooze in the Southern Pride. The meat on the ribs has a smoky flavor and a yielding tenderness but none of the falling-off-the-bone toothlessness of lesser barbecue. Bar Room at the Modern,New York,Midtown East,The bar area of the restaurant the Modern may not have the dining room's sculpture-garden view  but it does have a more accessible straightforward menu of dishes so satisfying that the trade-off is worth it. It's time to acknowledge that for some of the city's increasingly numerous multiple-personality restaurants one summary judgment cannot do justice to two parts. The Bar Room Í¢‘„‘î with its louder conversational hum and convivial air Í¢‘„‘î is its own gleaming success story acing a small-plates approach as well as any restaurant around town. Zoma,New York,Harlem,The modish minimalist dÍ—‘©cor tips you off that things are a little different at Zoma an Ethiopian restaurant just north of Central Park on Fredrick Douglass Boulevard. The azifa that well-spiced heap of lentil salad flecked through with onions and chilies isn't served on injera flatbread as it is elsewhere. Instead it arrives at the table cradled in leaves of endive like a canapÍ—‘© you might poach from a passed platter at a cocktail party. It's one of the touches that give the food at Zoma a tonier more citified treatment than it gets at other Ethiopian restaurants in New York.Guh Song,Queens,Bayside,Guh Song is among the many Korean-Chinese restaurants that dot Queens. The jjajangmyun is particularly well done with a deeply flavored sauce. The rich inky black bean sauce is loaded with tender bits of beef or pork and minced raw onions. The space in Oakland Gardens Queens which the restaurant has occupied since the 1980s is dowdy and brightly lighted.Sasabune,New York,Upper East Side,A white-walled nook on the Upper East Side Sasabune exemplifies a certain kind of sushi restaurant and experience: the unadorned serene refuge where diners submit to an omakase menu and to a chef with firm largely unwavering ideas about what and how he wants you to eat. 'No soy sauce!' bellow servers as they deposit his creations before you and you indeed obey. In return you get gorgeous fish creatively seasoned for prices less painful than at like-minded establishments. But the rhythm of service can be herky-jerky the application of sauces and scallions can be sloppy and the grace notes are few.The  Russian Tea Room,New York,Midtown,After a four-year hibernation the Russian Tea Room stirred to renewed life in early November with a seriously gifted chef Gary Robins in charge of the kitchen. His attempts to nod to restaurant's ethnic affiliation while indulging his culinary wanderlust has produced an engrossing tug-of-war and as it happens some terrific dishes including a riff on beef stroganoff with braised short rib and chanterelles. Inconsistency dogs the kitchen's efforts but the restaurant's real shortcoming is service that can be unforgivably poor in the context of entrees that frequently exceed $40 and appetizers that infrequently fall below $18. Cafe Cluny,New York,West Village,The latest branch on a sprawling fractious family tree that includes Odeon CafÍ—‘© Luxembourg Balthazar and Pastis CafÍ—‘© Cluny trades the swagger of a brasserie for the intimacy of a bistro. Geared for comfort and accessibility some of its dishes were wholly satisfying but weak spots were too common and service erratic. At lunchtime the smaller number of diners means less jostling and noise.Tocqueville,New York,Union Square,In an attempt to move on up in the restaurant scene Tocqueville moved from one end of a block of East 15th Street to the other in 2006. But the shortness of the distance belies the extent of the effect. Tocqueville now feels like a much more proper restaurant. Its shortcomings including uneven service are more noticeable in the context of a changed image and expectations but the considerable pleasures of Marco Moreira's cooking are intact as is a serious wine list. Try the duo of seared sirloin and braised short rib. The tenderness of the roasted chicken underscores the care this kitchen takes. Lucali,Brooklyn ,Carroll Gardens,Mark Iacono spent two years of nights after he finished his day job renovating the space that is now his pizzeria Lucali. He built everything including the wood-fired oven that perfumes the pies the dining room and the sidewalk outside the restaurant with the aroma of wood smoke. Spacious but cozy it's as nice a room to eat a pizza in as there is anywhere in the city. And though Mr. Iacono's are not the stuff of legend--at least not yet--he gets an incredibly crisp crust out of his oven and he tops it with a thin wash of sauce made from his grandmother's 'secret' recipe. A mix of mozzarella cheeses goes on next plus whatever toppings you choose then some grated Grana Padano. Order additional basil on every pie for the freshness it adds and a plain calzone like a steaming hot pillow of comfort in cheese and dough form on any visit. Spicy &amp; Tasty,Queens,Flushing,Spicy &amp; Tasty in Flushing Queens is one of the most aptly named restaurants in the five boroughs Í¢‘„‘î  and a showcase for Sichuan cooking that doesn't hold its fire in deference to many Westerners' palates. The blazing effects of numbing Sichuan peppercorns and hot chili peppers recur in one spicy dish after another. As for the other side of the ampersand there are juicy little shrimps with black bean paste shredded bean curd with an irresistibly bouncy texture and a scallion and egg fried rice whose fluffiness is a revelation. All of these dishes plus the modest prices compensate for a lack of atmosphere desserts and much in the way of alcohol.Porter House New York,New York,Upper West Side,Inheriting the space in the Time Warner Center that belonged to V Steakhouse Porter House New York takes a less cheeky more earnest approach to rib-eyes and strips. It marks the reemergence of Michael Lomonaco the chef at Windows on the World until 9\/11 and he's supervising a kitchen that cooks well-sourced cuts of meat with care. Other dishes and most appetizers were less successful and the food overall like the amber-glow ambience casts this restaurant as a generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in a lesser mall. It's like an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at the Outback Steak House.STK,New York,West Village,Slick dark noisy and in need of a vowel STK blurs the line between restaurant and nightclub; in other words it's in the meatpacking district. It attempts to feminize the steakhouse by including smaller cuts and it wants to do for filets and T-bones what the city's Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. Those steaks were fine but other dishes in the menu weren't and you have to be in the mood for circular white leather booths and a maelstrom of revelers.Lunetta,Brooklyn,Boerum Hill,There are plenty of Italian places that get the vibe right and the food wrong. Lunetta especially on a good night is not one of them: Adam Shepard can cook. The bold flavors of fresh herbs for which Mr. Shepard has a clear affinity are emphasized in most of the best dishes. Just expect inconsistency. Picholine,New York,Upper West Side,Picholine's stuffiness may well be chromosomal Í¢‘„‘î this Lincoln Center area restaurant is never going to feel youthful and hip. A lavender-on-lavender redo certainly hasn't helped. But the chef and owner Terrance Brennan seized the occasion of a cosmetic overhaul to reinvigorate the restaurant's soul stacking the menu with terrific dishes that carry a sense of fun. And Picholine still has the best cheese presentation in the city along with a glorious selection of Scottish game birds in the autumn and much of the winter.Boqueria,New York,Flatiron,Although the tapas spirit of snacking and grazing took root in this city long ago tapas themselves haven't been so easy to find. Boqueria is doing its bit to change that. Both the menu devoted to small plates and the space in which all the seats are the height of bar stools send the message that you needn't commit to a conventional meal. You can let your appetite wander and if you're smart you'll make sure it heads in the direction of dishes like squid salad patatas bravas and lamb shank. An array of Spanish wines are on hand along with different kinds of sangria.Meskel Ethiopian Restaurant,New York,East Village,Meskel serves meat but it's their vegetarian dishes that might bring you back. The combination plate includes a sampling of all of their vegetarian food: red lentils finished with berbere the same chili and spice combo in the tibs wat; kik alicha wat a deliciously dusty-tasting preparation of split peas enlivened with ginger and garlic; a heap of cooked collard greens called gomen; vegetarian meatballs made of ground chickpeas tossed in spicy chili sauce and called shiro wat; sautÍ—‘©ed green beans and carrots with ginger garlic and though it seems impossible more. This dish is the best thing to happen to East Village vegetarians in a long time. The owners of Meskel would probably blush at such a suggestion. Their menu proclaims that what they serve is 'just home cooking.' It is that certainly and so much more.Harry's Cafe and Steak,New York,Financial District,Harry's at Hanover Square has been reborn as Harry's Cafe and Steak with one wing that's more intimate and expensive and another Í¢‘„‘î the cafe Í¢‘„‘î that reaches in too many ill-advised directions. Like other newfangled steakhouses Harry's simultaneously buys into and bucks the traditional formula with muddled results. When it's simply applying clever tweaks to enduring favorites Í¢‘„‘î Serrano applesauce accompanies a hefty pork chop Í¢‘„‘î it excels. And its aged nicely charred bone-on strip can compete with any of the many steaks around town.Morgan Dining Room,New York,Midtown South,The new restaurant at the Morgan Library and Museum teaches the eternal pleasures of capitalism: marble fireplaces heavy silver and really rich cream sauces. The food served in a pristine white dining room used by the Morgan family is brightly flavored enough to please modern palates but also with touches like chicken fricassee crab salad and shrimp cocktail telegraphs Gilded-Age opulence. This new-old luxury mirrors the museum's transformation; it reopened in April 2006 after a renovation joining J. P. Morgan's original brownstone mansion to a glass center tower designed by Renzo Piano.La Tortilleria Los Hermanos,Bushwick,Bushwick,The menu at La TortillerÍ—‘_a Mexicana Los Hermanos a tortilla factory in Bushwick is sparse but when top-notch tacos are available how much else does one need? Tacos and their diminutive brethren taquitos made with tiny tortillas are built Mexican style with two tortillas to each taco. The vegetarian taco which feature beans sliced avocado and grated white cheese is fine. The chicken taco is hit-or-miss Í¢‘„‘î maybe better than that if red meat isn't your thing Í¢‘„‘î but the quality picks up significantly when you get to the meat-filled tacos. Closed in the winter. Royale,New York,East Village,With the glut of big-name burger openings it was a surprise to find that one of the city's best hamburgers isn't the handiwork of some fancypants chef. It was also surprising to see that the place serving it isn't as much a restaurant as it is a bar Royale in the East Village. Though it owes a significant debt to the burgers at Donovan's J. G. Melon's and Corner Bistro the Royale with cheese as it's called on the restaurant's terse menu is its own thing. There are certainly more refined pleasures to be had elsewhere Í¢‘„‘î places where the threat of Pat Benatar on the jukebox has been put in check places where vegetables are used for more noble purposes than to add color to a hamburger places where there are plates not just wicker baskets to eat out of. But sometimes a can of beer with a funny cartoon on it in one hand and a burger oozing meat juice in the other is the kind of pleasure a night calls for. And when it is Royale delivers.SobaKoh,New York,East Village,Though SobaKoh doesn't go out of its way to trumpet the seasonality of its menu dishes change regularly and usually are in step with what is in season. But the main attraction is soba. The buckwheat noodles rolled and cut by hand are made fresh a few times a day. Tempura a common tablemate to soba both hot and cold is also excellent at SobaKoh: a thin crackling crisp and nearly oil-free coating of batter encases whatever the kitchen is frying. If austerity isn't your thing there are options like cold noodles with gooey runny Japanese yam and raw quail egg or uni ikura soba cold soba tossed through with electric orange salmon eggs and topped with an even orange-er blob of sea urchin. Freemans,New York,Lower East Side,With its location at the end of a hidden alley and its taxidermy-heavy decor Freemans has an eccentric furtive atmospheric allure unlike any other Manhattan restaurant's. But the dishes on its menu Í¢‘„‘î a mix of pub grub comfort food and slightly more ambitious Continental fare Í¢‘„‘î are unevenly executed and more often disappointing than rewarding blotting out the pleasures of the setting and of well-mixed cocktails from a fine list of spirits.Trestle on Tenth,New York,Chelsea,Part of Tenth Avenue's expanding restaurant row Trestle on Tenth serves rebelliously hearty and sometimes seductively homey fare that reflects the Swiss upbringing of its chef-owner Ralf Kuettel. On a menu with such standouts as saddle of lamb veal kidneys and pork loin there were a few too many disappointments but Mr. Kuettel who knows wine has put together a list of affordable adventurous selections from small producers most of them European. It's a model of what a restaurateur without tons of money or storage space can do.Felidia,New York,Midtown East,Lidia Bastianich's celebrity (television shows books) goes far beyond this terrific restaurant which helped set her on her path. But the enduringly splendid Istrian and northern Italian food at Felidia shows that she isn't neglecting her roots. Felidia excels at game organ meat risotto and pasta dishes that showcase slow-cooked sauces using fatty meats. This is big stuff and the best of it commands attention without groveling for it hitting a midpoint between regal and rustic that's all their own. The wine list emphasizing northern Italy is great.Sake Bar Hagi,New York,Times Square Theatre District,The contrast between the caustically corporate after-work haunts in Times Square and the sake-buzzed looseness at Sake Bar Hagi a subterranean izakaya is one of its biggest charms. Another is the price: you can eat plenty and drink enough to ensure a mildly painful morning after without putting anything more than the lightest of dents in your bankroll. The food runs the gamut from familiar izakaya fare (like edamame and okonomiyaki) to dishes that would be familiar if you grew up in modern Japan (like spaghetti with bacon green peppers and ketchup.) The best dishes include yakitori and the sautes as well as daily specials listed on boards posted among the restaurant's many televisions.Sip Sak,New York,Midtown East,Many of the chef Orhan Yegen's best dishes aren't on the menu at this plain but comfortable Turkish restaurant with sunshine-colored walls. You have to know to ask for the shavings of lamb gyro over sauteed cubes of pita in a yogurt sauce. Or for the Turkish pizza which is really Syrian pizza. Or the special lamb sausage. And if you do ask for them you can have a superbly flavorful satisfying experience. Otherwise you'll encounter peaks (manti in a garlicky yogurt sauce) and valleys (dry chicken kebabs) in equal measure.Chao Thai,Elmhurst,Elmhurst,The food at Chao Thai a 25-seat restaurant in Elmhurst Queens is resolutely authentic: the kitchen's free hand with chiles and its facility for balancing sweet sour and salty flavors distinguish it from its brethren west of the East River. Know that hot means hot when you're ordering. And medium hot means hot too. Mild is not spoken at Chao Thai. Many of the dishes one typically eats with sticky rice Í¢‘„‘î like crispy pork in prik khing curry Í¢‘„‘î are excellent (though the sticky rice unfortunately isn't). Despite the pigÍ¢‘„‘Žs top billing this dish is really a pile of meaty toothsome freshly cooked green beans dotted through with juicy bits of fried pork belly and coated in a beguiling sauce redolent of kaffir lime leaves and mint. Not every dish is such a triumph but most everything is very good.The Mercer Kitchen,New York,SoHo,One of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's least compelling restaurants Mercer Kitchen occupies a sexy underground space with a darkness that flatters the food as well as the diners. The food needs it. While the brick-oven pizzas have bold toppings and roasted chicken does its modest duty plenty else suffers from a deficit of imagination and a lack of care in the kitchen and service can be distracted. It's less a culinary showcase than a SoHo version of Applebee's.Chinatown Brasserie,New York ,NoHo,The name is full of misdirection Í¢‘„‘î Chinatown Brasserie is actually in NoHo and it's not really a brasserie Í¢‘„‘î but nonetheless distills the approach that this restaurant is taking. It fuses refined versions of diners' favorite Chinese dishes with a recognizably hip stage that is not for the most part too tricked out. The egg roll meets the Odeon. Among a long roster of uneven dishes the dim sum selections which command the attention of their own dedicated chef stand out. Try the superb fish skin dumplings then try three or four other kinds. Dim sum frees you from culinary monogamy never asking you to commit. Farm on Adderley,Brooklyn,Ditmas,The Farm on Adderley is a new New American restaurant in Ditmas Park Brooklyn. The dining room is comfortable airy and spacious with plenty of room between tables; thereÍ¢‘„‘Žs a charming backyard for al fresco eating during warm weather. And though the dÍ—‘©cor is more city clean than country cluttered there are warm touches throughout like the antique oil lamps among the wine bottles and the mix-and-match vintage chairs that appoint the tables. Simple dishes like a salad bibb lettuce and sweet peas ($7) dressed with buttermilk and garnished with wisps of fried onion and the salad of heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella ($8) are the way to go. The farm burger ($11) which is hefty but not too hefty to fit on the toasted English muffin it is served on would be a welcome addition to any neighborhoodÍ¢‘„‘Žs dining scene. The thick-cut fries that come with it ($4 as a side) are almost problematically delicious. Other dishes had problems. A wan asparagus soup ($6) featured a poached egg that had been poached too long. Chicken-in-the-hay a breast roasted over alfalfa hay ($14) and served with quinoa was bland. The house-made pÍ—‘¢tÍ—‘© had the right flavor and the portion was ample but its texture was closer to meatloaf than to pÍ—‘¢tÍ—‘© proper. But with nimble ordering and more time for the kitchen to get its legs firmly underneath it getting a good meal out of the restaurant is far more likely than a farm on Adderley. Caracas Arepa Bar,New York,East Village,Caracas Arepa Bar opened in a broom closet of a space on Seventh Street in the East Village. The quality of its limited Venezuelan menu just arepas and empanadas except on weekends won it a loyal following. The tiny space meant long waits. Those loyalists have been rewarded with more room: Caracas took over a storefront two doors east of the original location with 34 additional seats for its good-looking largely bilingual customers to get their arepa fix. And under the stewardship of chef Ilse Parra it has expanded its menu to include entrees appetizers desserts and more Í¢‘„‘î and not just on the weekends. Caracas now boasts one of the most consistent kitchens of any cheap food spot in New York.The Little Owl,New York,West Village,Its size is modest Í¢‘„‘î 30 seats including the four barstools Í¢‘„‘î and so to some extent are its ambitions. But the Little Owl squarely and sweetly hits its target: straightforward full-flavored food like a hefty juicy pork chop with Parmesan butter beans and a 'crispy chicken' that lives up to its billing. The kitchen's care the servers' enthusiasm and the enormous windows onto an archetypal West Village corner give this restaurant a charm that eclipses the shortcomings of its wine list and desserts. At brunch have the pancakes.Las Ramblas,New York,West Village,Las Ramblas looks more like a tapas bar in Spain than much of its competition here in the city. The entire frontage of the small restaurant opens on to a busy stretch of West Fourth Street. One side of the room is dominated by a small bar; the other is crowded with counter-height tables ringed by stools. The best dish at Las Ramblas is a special though one the restaurant seems to offer fairly consistently Í_‘_ of huge langoustines cooked in cava and vinegar served sizzling hot in an earthenware dish. Their flesh is succulent and not overcooked the heads are loaded up with savory shrimpy juices just waiting to be sucked out. Cafe Condesa,New York,West Village,Cafe Condesa's menu which nods toward Spain but lacks the focus to be succinctly classified is modest and casual. Without the space for a full kitchen Cafe Condesa like so many affordably priced restaurants in the city relies on a battery of induction burners panini presses and toaster ovens. Working within those limitations it turns out a roster of dishes that are agreeable or better. One of the best is billed as a rack of lamb but is in reality a meaty double-cut rib chop ($12.75). It's not a lot of meat but the meat that is there is buttery and mild and cooked to the degree of doneness you specify. The dainty chop comes propped atop a buttery potato purÍ—‘©e that is ringed by a loop of garlicky chimichurri. There is also a fairly priced and fairly well-edited wine list to accompany the menu and as you might expect at a neighborhood cafe a full roster of coffee drinks. Service was friendly and attentive on every visit; any lags in the meals I ate there seemed to be the product of the tiny two-man kitchen trying to keep up with orders. It does not seem that Cafe Condesa is reaching for greater glory. Its menu is simple with reined-in flourishes and dishes that are creative enough to entice but not to challenge. Its prices are gentle enough that West Villagers who are won over by the restaurant's charms should be able to visit it regularly. On those terms its terms it is a success. Cafe Luxembourg,New York,Upper West Side,With its brasserie lite mien and an appealing menu that combines French stalwarts and American favorites Cafe Luxembourg still has charm. But this restaurant which opened in 1983 may at this point have been desired for so long that it's stopped fretting enough over its desirability. Service can be distracted and food under-seasoned or over-cooked. The most reliable stretch of the menu is the final one: the desserts are terrific.Northeast Kingdom,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Northeast Kingdom is a modest and charming spot with a short menu of simple dishes housed in a one-story building surrounded by blocks of factories and warehouses far enough east on the L line that even the most duplicitous realtor couldn't sell it as East Williamsburg. Menu staples include a dish of grilled lamb sausage a homey chicken potpie and a B.L.T. dressed up with a little balsamic-spiked mayonnaise. All are worthwhile. Don't miss the banana cream pie: crunchy crust custardy banana filling exploding with banana flavor freshly whipped cream on top. It's the slice of pie you hope will come out of that rotating pie display at a diner that never does.Aburiya Kinnosuke,New York,Midtown East,At Aburiya Kinnosuke in Midtown you won't spot any celebrities the way you might at lavish trendy downtown Japanese pleasure palaces like Megu or Nobu. What you will see are tables filled with Japanese businessmen getting something here that's more Tokyo than TriBeCa. Try the tuna neck a bony fatty almost musky cut. Or black sesame tofu. Or pickled Japanese sticky yam. Know that you'll encounter some unpleasant flavor sensations along with servers who don't speak much English and sometimes don't pay enough attention. But chalk it all up to adventure and an often delicious one at that. Bann,New York,Clinton,Bann is an offshoot of Woo Lae Oak in SoHo and like Woo Lae Oak it wagers that the participatory theater and straightforward results of center-of-table grilling are bound to have an audience. Onto ours went slices of boneless beef short rib satisfying on their own and when wrapped along with rice and sweet miso paste in big leaves of red-leaf lettuce. The long menu cobbles together Asian traditions and non-Asian touches with mixed results; the prudent strategy may be to order conservatively to stick to those grills. The tables around them are marble. The floors beneath them are tiled in stone. The windows are tall and broad. Kimchi has certainly known less polished appealing digs. Goodburger,New York,Midtown East,Goodburger is a Turtle Bay burger joint backed by Nick Tsoulous of Patsy's pizza fame. Its core offering is a grilled 5.5-ounce patty well seasoned and beefy on a toasted bun just larger than the patty ($4.75). Cheese made it better (50 cents more) as did the works: pickles lettuce tomatoonion ketchup mayo and mustard (included in the price). Burgers are grilled to doneness with remarkable accuracy for a fast-food place; medium is standard unless a diner specifies otherwise and a medium cheeseburger with the works is just bun-soakingly juicy enough. Those who don't like beef might dine elsewhere: the grilled chicken sandwich ($5.25) is a lame retread of the burger with a charred chicken breast in place of the patty; the grilled cheese is simply a cheeseburger minus the burger a paltry concession to vegetarians that is not worth $4.50. Ninja New York,New York,TriBeCa,Confusing the point of a restaurant with the mission of a &amp;quot;Saturday Night Live&amp;quot; skit Ninja New York deposits diners in a kooky dreary subterranean labyrinth that spreads over 6000 square feet is meant to evoke a Japanese mountain village and seems better suited to coal mining than supping. The servers in black costumes play the parts of ninjas and perform magic something the kitchen doesn't do. Only about a third of the quasi-Japanese food is particularly good and that's much too small a fraction for a restaurant where the bill can easily exceed $100 a person.Il Buco,New York,NoHo,Like the proverbial room with a view restaurants that are as warm and bewitchingly romantic as Il Buco have a serious obstacle to overcome. Confronted with stunning scenery or captivating atmosphere it is easy to slip into cynicism about the food. But say this for Il Buco: it has put much effort if not more into creating a Mediterranean menu as beguiling as the antiques-strewn dining room. The chef Ed Winn has an easy way of creating combinations that taste as good as they sound especially in his short list of main courses which change daily.Abboccato,New York,Midtown,Abboccato is the 21st-century version of an Italian-American restaurant. There are no red tablecloths no candles stuck in raffia-covered wine bottles no lasagna or garlic bread. Its menu is a bit of a jumble but often a pleasing one. The chefs are cooking some interesting but seldom seen regional dishes and creating a few delightful combinations that would never see the light of day in Italy. Highlights include the black bass and the bomboloni (a k a doughnuts).Egg,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Most of the dinner menu at Egg which initially attracted attention for its breakfast-only menu is guileless direct and plain good eating. Other dishes are distinguished by the conscientious approach of the kitchen. The pimento cheese toast that is part of a 'sample plate' (also including a beet-pickled egg a deviled egg and a pile of country ham shavings) is better than most because the kitchen makes it from scratch with Grafton Cheddar cheese and freshly roasted peppers. And the fried chicken is good. So good I watched a Southern-born friend devour nearly two whole portions in one sitting. Ben &amp; Jack's Steak House,New York,Midtown East,Who needs Peter Luger when several of its former waiters and a grill cook have decamped to this latest attempt to imitate that legendary steakhouse in Brooklyn? It's unfortunate that the food at Ben &amp; Jack's strives to mimic Peter Luger's rather than to aim higher. The prices for steak are nearly identical at the two restaurants. The question is whether either one is worth it. And at Ben &amp; Jack's when the service is off the answer is definitely no. Unfortunately the food at Ben &amp; Jack's is equally uneven.Cercle Rouge,New York,TriBeCa,David FÍ—‘©au who was the last chef at LutÍ—‘Îce will open his own boutique restaurant with a raw bar and a French bistro menu that also offers the chef's interpretation of New England clam chowder and fish and chips. Nobu 57,New York,Midtown,The name says it all. Nobu 57 isn't a new dining experience. It's an old one on a new block Nobu in a different (and as it happens very spiffy) suit. Its menu and food elicit not so much a stab as a full-on body blow of the familiar - lightly battered rock shrimp in a spicy mayonnaise miso-glazed black cod. They're terrific along with most of the rest of the dishes. If they're not innovative well that's partly because Nobu Matsuhisa was so far ahead of the game when he opened Nobu with its Japanese-Latin fusion in TriBeCa in 1994 and because so many restaurants imitated it.Oriental Garden,New York,Chinatown,If you want to make the acquaintance of your dinner before you ingest it this is your place. Stacked at the entrance are tanks of crabs prawns and clams but they're displayed in a matter-of-fact rather than theatrical fashion the first indication that Oriental Garden is about the freshness of ingredients and no-nonsense preparations that highlight that. The atmosphere is negligible and some of the dishes forgettable. But the best dishes - like fried geoduck clam belly steamed whole sea bass - validate the estimation of many Chinese-Americans and food fans who consider this Chinatown's best seafood restaurant.Sarabeth's,New York,Midtown,This Sarabeth's like its siblings traffics in warm and fuzzy and strives in part to be a fluffy afghan of a place. But some things are different: This Sarabeth's is by far the biggest of the brood with more than 175 seats. Where the others have prominently placed bakery counters it has a prominently placed bar. The menu doesn't promise adventure. It promises heartiness and hominess. And much of the time it delivers. 'Wichcraft,New York,Midtown South,The Tom Colicchio-backed fancy sandwich chainlet 'wichcraft kiosks span the Sixth Avenue end of Bryant Park. All the standards are good but the more restauranty offerings are better bets and better values.Perry St.,New York,West Village,After the high-concept flamboyance of 66 Spice Market and V Steakhouse Jean-Georges Vongerichten retreats to a subdued (though extremely lovely) setting for less gimmicky food that reflects his culinary strengths and sensibility more tidily than any of his restaurants since his flagship Jean Georges which opened in 1997. The menu is concise but the best dishes beautifully capture his instinct for flavor and texture combinations his usually keen sense of equilibrium and of course his recruitment of traditions and ingredients from Asia which seduced him before others. This one's from the heart not the head.Rickshaw Dumpling Bar,New York,Midtown South,Anyone who has had Anita Lo's fusion of foie gras and Shanghai-style soup dumplings at her restaurant Annisa knows she is capable of considerable dumpling wizardry. But that magic isn't there at Rickshaw Dumpling Bar the dumpling shop in Chelsea where she consults. Some items have inched closer to deliciousness since it opened but much of the food still lacks oomph. Shake Shack,New York,Midtown South,Danny Meyer started the big-name simplicity and seems to have done it best. His restaurant group ran a Chicago-style hot dog cart in Madison Square Park for three years before the Parks Department let it build Shake Shack a permanent seasonal concession stand in 2004. Shake Shack presents an idealized jumble of a number of regional styles of junk food under one ivy-covered roof. Only the Chicago-style hot dog that paragon of American hot dog excellence is presented in an unadulterated form. And the salty meaty little burgers swaddled by potato rolls are so good that Shake Shack is swarmed with diners willing to wait 20 minutes or more to order.Waldy's Wood-Fired Pizza &amp; Penne,New York,Midtown South,Waldy is Waldy Malouf the chef of Beacon on West 56th Street a restaurant with a reputation for wood oven cooking but not or not widely for its pizza. Here's the good news about his new pizza venture: toppings especially the more adventurous ones are largely top-notch. But the crust makes or breaks a pizza and at Waldy's prestretched dough sits in plastic-covered piles looking as uninspired as it tastes even after a journey through the wood oven in the back of the narrow space.Momoya,New York,Chelsea,Momoya inhabits the Chelsea space that belonged to Meriken which also served Japanese food. A redesign has been done and a lovely one at that creating the kind of clean bright blond environment in which sushi seems to thrive. Momoya isn't a restaurant that seeks to captivate diners with blazingly original dishes. It doesn't aim big but it aims prudently and pleasingly. Its menu presents a now familiar breakdown of many appetizers and other small plates a smaller number of more conventional main courses a thicket of salads a tangle of noodles a bevy of sushi and sashimi and a litany of rolls. A special delight is a main course of broiled Chilean sea bass with lemon miso sauce.La Esquina,New York,SoHo,With its sexy subterranean vault of a dining room its unmarked and sentry-patrolled door its air of exclusivity and mystery and its Mexican menu La Esquina is sort of like Studio 54 with chipotle subbing for cocaine. The food (taquitos quesadillas baby back ribs whole grilled fish) is always serviceable sometimes distinguished and less often exemplary. But there are scores of tequilas smartly chosen music and a unforgettable dÍ—‘©cor of weathered brick and wrought-iron gates that evoke prison bars. If the Phantom of the Opera hired Zorro as an interior decorator and asked him to do something in contemporary Torquemada the result might resemble this.Zabb Queens,Jackson Heights,Woodside,Zabb Queens in Jackson Heights features the simple but interesting cuisine of the Isaan region of Thailand. Chilies are deployed with abandon in Isaan cooking. Fermented and salty flavors are prominent. Coconut milk is scarce. Salads particularly labbs (catfish and pork are the best bets) and the unripe papaya salad called som tum are a specialty of the region. Nam tok best with pork and goong sa duak with sweet grilled shrimp are also worth ordering. And the mixed seafood Thai hot pot is excellent and portioned generously enough to feed four.Spigolo,New York,Upper East Side,In a charming and intimate but disruptively noisy room on the Upper East Side Spigolo serves honest earnest Italian and Mediterranean fare with a slight emphasis on seafood and an avoidance of any and all pretension. The restaurant is run by the husband and wife team of Scott and Heather Fratangelo. He minds the kitchen; she's the gracious hostess and it turns out the one responsible for the terrific desserts. If you navigate this menu in the right way heading toward the grilled baby octopus or the garganelli in a sweet sausage ragu you'll reach a very happy destination.Saravana Bhavan,New York,Kips Bay,Generosity is a virtue at this Southern India-style restaurant. Take the kaima idli an enormous serving of chopped idli fried until crisp and sauteed in a sauce of spices and onions. It had an appealing touch of heat and I would have been satisfied with half the portion but that didn't stop me from eating the whole thing. And regretting it a little when served a Mysore onion dosa so large it extended well beyond the bounds of its platter.Shimizu Sushi,New York,Clinton,When you walk into Shimizu a small serene Japanese restaurant on the edge of the theater district the first thing you notice is the sushi bar: slabs of glistening fish behind a transparent partition a hunched-over chef with a sharp knife and a balletlike grace and fluidity of movement. If you're smart you'll sample his handiwork because the sushi is lovely and prepared correctly. The slivers of fish aren't too cold. The rice cakes aren't too big and clumpy. Shimizu is a worthy stop for anyone who appreciates first-rate sushi and tempura and happens to be in this section of town.Taboon,New York,Clinton,At Taboon a Middle-Eastern inflected restaurant in the Clinton section of midtown Manhattan it's all about the oven: a brick-walled cement-coated wood-burning hive that's situated near the entrance and grabs your attention the minute you walk in the door. Taboon in fact is an Arabic word for oven. The restaurant uses its star cooking implement for a terrific roster of dishes such as halibut in a tomato and red pepper ragout. The hummus spiked with jalapeno is terrific and the falafel crowned with a dollop of pickled mango is even better. Service fluctuates from vigilant to spectral.Coals,The Bronx,Morris Park,Coals is unlike any other pizza place in the Bronx Í¢‘„‘î or in the rest of the city for that matter. The pies it slings are not coal oven wood oven or oven baked at all. They are grilled. All of Coals' pizzas (and two of its desserts) start out as lumps of pizza dough made with white flour whole wheat flour and cornmeal. The whole wheat imbues the finished crust with a fuller flavor than some other pizzas; the finely ground cornmeal lends an appealingly gritty textural note. Overnight fermentation of the dough imparts an appreciable tang that's amplified by the charred flavor from the grill. The pizzas stretched by hand range from almost oval to nearly rectangular in shape; all are striped with tar-black grill marks and speckled with tiny burst air bubbles on both sides. The best bets are those that count tomato among their toppings Í¢‘„‘î they add a balancing sweet note--and those that aren't overloaded dragging the dough down with them.Breeze,New York,Clinton,At Breeze an electric Thai-French fusion place in Clinton the food has plenty to compete with but what's on the plate wins. The menu which uses words like glacÍ—‘© and gastrique is a quilt of influences patched together by Jeff Hardinger. Many recipes riff on classics elevating rather than reinventing the original dish. The soups are standouts as are the pork belly sandwich the duck confit salad and the pork loin with glass noodle sausages. For drinks stick with beer; the cocktails don't do anything for the food.Gusto Ristorante e Bar Americano,New York,West Village,In a big way Gusto Ristorante e Bar Americano goes entirely with the flow. In smaller ways it swims against the current. It's conformist and contrary familiar and unexpected leaning on a cuisine of amply proven popularity but then giving it shadings and a kind of showcase that it doesn't always get. The chef Jody Williams won many fans in her previous outings at Il Buco and Giorgione but I don't think she has fully honed her act or fine-tuned the operation of the kitchen at Gusto just yet. BarbÍ—‘Îs,New York,Midtown South,The food at BarbÍ—‘Îs is maddeningly uneven but some of it has the straightforward satisfying appeal of bistro fare. The Moroccan dishes aren't necessarily the better ones but they're the most interesting because they're the least commonplace. Arguably the best appetizer is a salad sampler that showcases the restaurant's hummus and its zaalouk a divinely smoky mash of eggplant tomato cumin paprika and lemon juice. The tagines disappoint but the couscous was good in all circumstances.The Red Cat,New York,Chelsea,By turns cozy and sexy laid-back and fleet the Red Cat is that rare split-the-difference place that has sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly. It's a restaurant Rorschach different things at different times to different people mining a culinary middle ground between Continental and new American timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan. And it's immensely appealing.Cafe Steinhof,Brooklyn,Park Slope South,With its wraparound windows and neon sign Cafe Steinhof in Park Slope is just about New York's homiest Austrian outpost. The cooking is simple the preparation often slapdash and a full meal can be had for less than $15. Highlights include sauerbraten goulash spaetzle sausages with sauerkraut and for dessert linzer torte.Stanton Social,New York,Lower East Side,The Stanton Social doesn't have designated entrees or appetizers just scores of dishes to be shared. Those dishes include potato and goat cheese pierogies meatballs in tomato sauce beef Wellington and French onion soup made into individual dumplings. Welcome to a veritable canapÍ—‘©-a-palooza and welcome to the restaurant as iPod play list: all favorites and no filler a compendium of highlights with no allegiance to a single source of inspiration. It's an ideal restaurant for people with commitment phobias or attention deficits. In fact it's a pretty good (albeit very uneven) restaurant in general thanks to the talent and imagination of the chef Chris Santos.Sabry's,Astoria,Astoria,No one is going to Sabry's an Egyptian spot in Astoria for its looks. They are going for fish. Whole fish are available baked and grilled. The waiters if you prompt them will encourage you to go with the baked option. Follow their lead. Baked or grilled the fish are seasoned with lemon oil and cumin cooked quickly and expertly and served without adornment save a sprinkling of fresh herbs. The tagines are also excellent as are the fried seafood combo and grilled octopus. Note that no alcohol is served or allowed in the restaurant.The Islands,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,The quirks make the Islands a tiny Jamaican spot in Brooklyn feel like a home kitchen but it's the food prepared with unwavering care that makes it worth a visit. Highlights include jerk leg of lamb curry goat curry shrimp and though you probably won't have room bread pudding for dessert. If you don't feel like waiting for food downstairs there are steep stairs leading to a dining loft lighted with candles and decorated with seashells parrots and floral prints that feels like a secret hideaway. Once there you'll want to sip homemade concoctions like gingery limeade sweetened with brown sugar and sorrel so heavily steeped and spiced it seemed spiked.Koi,New York,Midtown South,It's big bold and delightfully kooky with a latticed white canopy that evokes the honeycombs of a beehive or the strands of a spider's web. But in the end Koi seems much more invested in eye-popping props and pulse-pounding music than in the performance of its kitchen which commits too many errors and turns out too many duds for a restaurant this vain and expensive. The cuisine is Japanese fused at times with other genres and with luck you can have an intriguing and even delightful meal. But that outcome is much less certain than the sexy vibe.Periyali,New York,Flatiron,When Periyali opened in 1987 upscale Greek was an oxymoron a gyro-defying leap of imagination and faith. This restaurant has changed little since then promising diners a lulling antidote to the restless innovation and runaway imagination in so many other restaurants. None of the food wows most of it quietly impresses. The octopus appetizer and the lamb chop and moussaka entrees are particularly fine. The mixed Greek olives that are start a meal are a happy greeting and a happy goodbye comes in the form of creamy Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts. Some diners might find Periyali to be a bit of a yawn. I prefer to think of it as a pleasant sigh. -- Frank BruniUva,New York,Upper East Side,Uva the offspring of Lusardi's an old-school Italian haunt up the block seems like the wild child of that starched stalwart with a kitchen that is up till 2 a.m. and a design borrowed from the shabbier if more chic districts downtown. The menu draws from rustic kitchens up and down the Italian peninsula but its execution is more elaborate. Highlights include chisolini ricotta gnocchi scallops wrapped in speck and all desserts.Tsukushi,New York,Murray Hill,The wood-paneled walls at Tsukushi just off the bustle of Second Avenue where 41st Street heads uphill toward Tudor City give it the look of a seventies rec room. But the chef Norihiko Manabe has a real talent for orchestrating a meal. He works alone or with one other cook devising six- or seven-course menus and dispatching the food himself darting in and out of a kitchen hidden behind louvered shades. Selection changes nightly Í¢‘„‘î everything is omakase chef's choice Í¢‘„‘î but highlights have included country-style stews sashimi and very unusual shumai in which sticky rice stands in for wonton wrappers. Cafe 2 and Terrace 5,New York,Midtown,The Modern a glossy upscale restaurant attached to the museum includes a casual barroom but the Modern is as much a stand-alone entity as an appendage: you don't need to visit the museum to dine here. Cafe 2 and Terrace 5 in contrast are accessible only to visitors to the museum and are deep inside it. That they are intended to be more than just refueling stations for art lovers with empty stomachs is obvious in their pedigree: they are under the supervision of Danny Meyer and the Union Square Hospitality Group. It's also obvious in their menus and in the care taken with the way they look. Highlights at the Cafe include the buffalo's milk mozzarrella and creamy sheep's milk ricotta with roasted beets. Terrace 5 concentrates more on desserts.Gari,New York,Upper West Side,Gari is the spawn of Sushi of Gari an unadorned uncomfortably jammed cranny on the Upper East Side with a cult following. In this case the child improves upon the parent providing a more serene Í¢‘„‘î though by no means spacious Í¢‘„‘î setting and going beyond sushi and sashimi to offer cooked dishes. But raw or barely cooked fish remains the star and rightly so: the quality of it is very high and Gari makes artful compositions out of sushi gussying it up more than it typically is. My one big quibble with this restaurant is its expensiveness which seems out of synch with the neighborhood and with the matter-of-factness of the service and ambience.Picket Fence,Brooklyn,Ditmas,If you're allergic to cute stay away from Picket Fence. It oozes from this place like cream from a profiterole. But if you can stand it or better yet delight in it you're in for some good eating. Unlike the decor the menu doesn't play it too precious running instead to seasonal American standards that are carefully prepared like a nicely charred cheeseburger on a feathery brioche bun.Duane Park,New York,NoHo,This restaurant and nightclub which closed in TriBeCa in February has reopened on the Bowery.Mojito,Brooklyn,Clinton Hill,At Mojito new dishes mix amiably with Cuban classics fruity drinks haven't pushed a selection of fine rums off the menu and Cuban kitsch doesn't overwhelm the Brooklynness of the place. The concoction is well balanced like a good cocktail. Recommended dishes include tostones rellenos pernil moros y Cristianos and the fine Cuban sandwich.Taci's Beyti,Brooklyn,Sheepshead Bay,Taci's Beyti a warm comfortable kebab house is all about family. It's been that way almost from the day Taci Bek opened the doors in 1988. Ersin Bek his son runs the restaurant with a crew of Turkish cooks who haven't changed the menu much since the start. Nor should they. The food here is as homey and reliable as the atmosphere. Highlights include: leek or artichoke meze eggplant purÍ—‘©e fried liver cubes French fries lamb casserole kebabs and kunefe a sweet cheese layered with shredded dough and drenched in honey syrupDinosaur Bar-B-Que,New York,Harlem,New York may never be a great barbecue town. Still the hopes of barbecue-loving New Yorkers were lifted when the owners of the beloved Dinosaur Bar-B-Que of Syracuse turned a drafty former meatpacking house in West Harlem into their third outlet. Much of the place reeks of BBQ Disney. More importantly rather than a heady combination of smoke fat and spice the defining flavor profile is sweet. The meat comes from big black computerized smoking pits in a back room vented to high heaven and fueled with a mix of apple and hickory woods. But the mix of technology and wood isn't working. There are a few good barbecue moments to be had (the brined half-chicken the satisfying pork shoulder) but it will take something short of a miracle to turn Dinosaur Bar-B-Que into the barbecue refuge New Yorkers have been hoping for.Lure Fishbar,New York,SoHo,Fashioned to evoke the teak-paneled cabin of a luxury yacht Lure Fishbar makes a nifty visual promise of communion with the high seas. But with several of its raw and cooked dishes it fails to trust the fruits of those waters letting the condiments steer the ship. The atmosphere is seductive and the quality of the seafood is very fine so oysters are a smart choice and relatively unadorned entrees like surf and turf are likely to please. (So do the ice cream sandwiches an irresistibly hokey dessert not to be missed.) But other dishes are subjected to excessive intrusive primping. It's mutiny by a bounty of relishes and vinaigrettes.Krystal's Cafe,Queens,Woodside,The preparations at Krystal's Cafe in Woodside like the chicken adobo and pancit bihon are simple and straightforward. The short rib-tamarind soup is invigorating and appetite-stirring unusual and welcome attributes for a short rib dish. Vegetable dishes are a waste of calories you should spend on barbecue like the marinated grilled pork belly. If you're out for adventure there is a pork blood stew on the menu.  But the truth is Filipino cuisine is as homey and accessible as any kind of cooking.La Masseria,New York,Times Square Theatre District,La Masseria isn't one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and it won't give you the meal of your life or even your month. But it does what many a respectable restaurant should: suits a given set of circumstances and solves a riddle of requirements. Where do you go if your evening is taking you to a Broadway show if you want to eat just a few paces from the theater and if you want something that feels wholly comfortable and a bit indulgent but not reckless? You go here to a spacious dining room decorated to evoke the feel of a farmhouse. That design is a cue for hearty fare the best of which includes a fritto misto of seafood a pasta dish with eggplant and smoked mozzarella and a gigantic juicy veal chop. Skip desserts which are not the restaurant's strong point.Spike Hill,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,At Spike Hill a cozy tavern with dark wood and good beer in Williamsburg Brooklyn the meal practically sells itself. Fish and chips is as emblematically British as it gets; Spike Hill's version is perfectly executed. The burger is a serious misfire but the steak is fatty and well seasoned and a disarmingly good deal. The inviting bar that runs most of the length of the space has a wide selection of beers from pubby stalwarts you'd expect on tap like Guinness and Old Speckled Hen to off-kilter American bottles like Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye or Victory Brewing's Golden Monkey. Casa la Femme,New York,West Village,The nature of your response to Casa la Femme North which serves Egyptian food in an ersatz Alexandria under the Queensboro Bridge largely boils down to this: How much music and midriff do you like with your mezes? The belly dancer begins whirling through the dining room after 9 p.m. so you can avoid the show by supping early. But there's really no escaping Casa la Femme North's facile exoticism built around such obvious props as palm fronds and shisha (a.k.a. hookah) pipes and such over-the-top indulgences as the private tents that ring the dining room. If this brand of sybaritic adventure suits you then by all means go because the food Í¢‘„‘î from hot pita with tahini to perfectly grilled chicken and lovely lamb Í¢‘„‘î is impressive. Make sure not to miss the superior baklavaMaggie Brown,Brooklyn,Clinton Hill,Named after the grandmother of one of the owners Maggie Brown's menu reflects notions of international grandma cuisine a mishmash of Mexican Italian French Asian and Southern dishes that is frustratingly unfocused. In spite (or maybe because) of this it is of those quirky neighborhood fixtures where you can always find something you are craving. Maggie Brown is at her best during weekend brunch when the sun streams in through the windows and the kitchen turns out fluffy stacks of pancakes and sizable omelets. For dinner there's simple charred hanger steak with garlic butter and greaseless cornmeal-crusted fried chicken.En Japanese Brasserie,New York,West Village,En Japanese Brasserie does artisanal tofu and burdock root. Its claim is Japanese home-style cooking and the spirit of the izakaya a Japanese pub. But what is so paradoxically striking about En Japanese Brasserie is how familiar and redundant it feels how faithfully this transglobal translation of an izakaya follows a Manhattan formula: somewhat hip location; large visually arresting space; long menu that emphasizes small plates and accommodates rampant carbohydrate phobias. Less ascetic diners can try special rice dishes which are like much of the food: satisfying at the moment of ingestion; forgotten 30 minutes later. To wash it down there are many varieties of sake and shochu.Frankies 457 Court Street Spuntino,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,At least partly because of their gravy the two Frankies who run this casual brick-wrapped restaurant Í¢‘„‘î Frankie Castronovo and Frankie Falcinelli Í¢‘„‘î quickly won over their Carroll Gardens neighborhood. Loose-tied locals wander in after work for a glass of cabernet franc and maybe a crostino before dinner. Beyond that the chefs have adapted Italian-American recipes in the way that cheap-and-chic trattorias made regional Italian trendy with better-than-usual ingredients a dash of nostalgia and some creative interpretation. The antipasto plate and sandwiches are always good ways to go.DÍ—‘©vi,New York,Union Square,There are restaurants that bring you back to yourself and those that spirit you away. Devi belongs to the latter group. It casts its spell visually with glowing blue and red and yellow lights and it works its exotic magic through its take on Indian food more varied multidimensional nimble and surprising here than at the scores of samosa factories throughout these vindaloo-bewitched precincts. The chefs Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur who worked together at Amma do not feel bound by your expectations. Yes you can have chicken tikka masala but your server will more likely steer you toward crispy fried okra yam dumplings Manchurian cauliflower and less familiar dishes. The prawns and lamb were cooked perfectly in the tandoor. But chicken and beef did not fare as well and a few dishes were pricey in relation to the portions. Mancora,New York,East Village,Mancora caters to East Villagers and a raucous subset of them at that. Its jaunty room is buoyant with sangria-sipping crowds and South American soundtracks especially on weekends. Peruvian cooks have a way with rotisserie birds; here the chicken is tongue-numbing marinated in sticky-sweet dark beer then rubbed with garlic oregano and fennel and roasted to a blackened crisp and juicy underneath. As long as the kitchen is not overwhelmed grilled dishes like nicely marbled sirloin are worthy. The rest of Mancora's menu hits and misses. But if you know what you're looking for and it happens to be ceviche or chicken or a night on the town you will leave pleased. That's particularly true if you discover the dense eggy baked flan drenched in dark caramel before you depart.Sripraphai,Woodside,Woodside,Too many Thai restaurants in this country and this city temper the heat of Thai cooking and amplify the sweetness in dishes as concessions to American palates. Sripraphai in the Woodside section of Queens maintains the more finely nuanced balance that this wonderful Asian cuisine is supposed to have. The spices are less muted and the herbs fresher than at most Thai restaurants. The meat is more tender. Among many wonderful boldly flavored dishes try the sauteed &amp;quot;drunken'' noodles the roasted duck salad the pickled barbecued pork. The atmosphere is unremarkable seafood dishes were disappointing and desserts are limited but the inexpensive prices make the bang for buck here atomic.Kuma Inn,New York,Lower East Side,Kuma Inn serving a kind of Asian tapas is an auteur restaurant if there ever was one sprung entirely from the chef King Phojanakong's imagination. The dishes are tapas in theory and price structure only. Excluding the cheapest plates Í¢‘„‘î shumai with belly-punches of wasabi and steamed edamame slick with lime-basil oil and sea salt Í¢‘„‘î they're not that diminutive. Seared sausage with caramelized onions and sticky rice and tiny steamed mussels are both excellent. The priciest dishes like pan-roasted striped bass are more elaborate.Indochine,New York,East Village,I cannot remember many details of my visits to Indochine in the 1980's but I vividly recall how special it felt to be there. Just sitting amid the tropical-bordello decor made me feel that a bit of the glitter of its fabulous clientele would rub off on me. Food was beside the point. Indochine was the apotheosis of an extremely profitable idea: the downtown restaurant as badge of knowingness and belonging. Indochine as it once existed inevitably died. It has become a museum more or less that draws young people who consider it an anachronistic hoot patrons of the Public Theater who need a nearby trough and tourists who do not know any better.Yakitori Totto,New York,Midtown,On a quiet bit of 55th Street that caters to a largely Japanese crowd Yakitori Totto sits up a long set of stairs from Sugiyama a well-regarded kaiseki restaurant at street level. The restaurant takes the chicken as its symbol and though the menu has something to sate the craving of every meat lover chicken is the focus. All the dark meat is good; liver is crisped and charred outside succulent within. Nuggets of chicken grilled with negi a robust cousin of scallions is essential as is shishito peppers stuffed with minced breast meat. But chicken is the tip of the iceberg. There is also a full menu of omelets fried chicken and tofu dishes that are expertly executed.Kittichai,New York,SoHo,In Kittichai's liberally and fantastically interpreted Thailand the orchids do not bloom in vases on the tables. They twist in an ersatz spider web above a dark reflecting pool in the center of the dining room. Dinner here is not so much like a night in Bangkok as a night in Bangkok in a David Lynch movie and lucky for us the gustatory pleasures rise almost to the level of the visuals ones. Thai ingredients and seasonings are used with the kinds and quality of meats that your neighborhood Thai restaurant may not have. There is Chilean sea bass in a glaze of palm sugar and red curry paste monkfish in a yellow curry and best of all braised short ribs in a green curry. A few dishes do not work but many more do.Ici,Brooklyn,Fort Greene,A tall maple tree shades the Brooklyn backyard of Ici a sweet restaurant full of unpretentious pleasures just like that broad canopy of leaves. The greens in salads are fresh and sensibly dressed. The skate is nicely cooked. The wine list is interesting focusing on small European vineyards that use biodynamic techniques. There is both sophistication and good sense in this Fort Greene bistro and in its French owners Laurent and Catherine Saillard who also serve a pleasant breakfast.Minca,New York,East Village,Shigeto Kamada says he despaired of finding good ramen in New York. So he taught himself to make  it by reading books and watching videos. Now he is satisfying similar appetites at Minca a little ramen shop he opened in the East Village. He calls Minca a ramen factory but there is little about the place that suggests an assembly line. If you take a seat at the bar and order the basic ramen you can watch Mr. Kamada assemble it before you. When it comes to eating the ramen experience can be a bit like taking a steam bath yet the ramen is so good that you do not want to stop.Kombit,Brooklyn,Prospect Heights,The food at Kombit is homey and affordable and those new to Haitian food could not ask for a better introduction. Kombit refers to the Haitian tradition of communal farming and feasting and so the dining room is decorated with agrarian scenes. Most tables begin with fritay lakay a generous sampler including plantain battered sweet potatoes and fritters that deliver a creamy whoosh of yautia a Haitian root. There are a few disappointments but Kombit like many traditional Haitian kitchens has a wonderful way with fish as long as you like red snapper (it is the only fish served) and do not mind bones heads and tails. The real star of the restaurant is the piklis a sinus-clearing cabbage-carrot slaw which comes with everything.Tulcingo Del Valle,New York,Clinton,Though New York has increased its Mexican options we still need places like Del Valle where the menu is hopelessly traditional but the food is fresh bright and satisfying.  The amenities of Del Valle which has transformed itself from a glorified deli into a modest restaurant are few but appealing especially in the impersonal wilds of Clinton. And it has a huge menu of simple classic Mexican lunch-counter food with a few real gems: the tacos tortas (sandwiches) and the hard-to-find cemita a sesame-seed roll stuffed with mild cheese whole chipotle peppers roast meat avocado and papalo an herb that tastes like the love child of cilantro and arugula.Wolfgang's Steakhouse,New York,Midtown South,Named for Í¢‘„‘î and partly run by Í¢‘„‘î a former head waiter at Peter Luger in Brooklyn Wolfgang's Steakhouse tries to replicate the beefy rapture of that carnivores' temple on the Manhattan side of the East River smack in Midtown. To assess that attempt a friend and I ate Steak for Two (a mammoth porterhouse) at Wolfgang's shortly after 6:30 one night and then shortly before 9:30 Steak for Two (another mammoth porterhouse) at Luger. Luger won the contest Í¢‘„‘î but not by much. The steaks at Wolfgang's are plenty terrific: nicely charred on the outside tender deep within and full of flavor. Wolfgang's offers more seafood and salad options than Luger though a few of these deviations from the steakhouse norm yield less than exciting results. Avoid the swordfish. Embrace the tuna. But really eat the beef. That's what this is all about.Megu,New York,TriBeCa,Without a machete and a G.P.S. device there is no easy way to navigate the thicket that is Megu's menu: seemingly infinite iterations of toro and Kobe sushi and sashimi. Are these starters or main courses? Best eaten in a certain sequence? Neither the menu nor the servers make that wholly clear. If it reined itself in it might be one of the most thrilling dining experiences in the city. It occupies a colossal space in TriBeCa that has been spectacularly designed. Its chef Koji Imai making his American debut puts top-tier ingredients to often sumptuous use. You will pay dearly for this pleasure: a meal at Megu can easily cost $100 for the food alone and that indeed seems like too much except when you are eating the sauteed shrimp in a citrus and pepper cream sauce. Like many of the too-many dishes at Megu it's a knockout.Loreley,New York,Lower East Side,Loreley an urban beer garden on the Lower East Side has a simple but satisfying menu. With wursts from Schaller &amp; Weber the traditional German butcher in Yorkville the restaurant caters to New York's downtown expatriate German community and the hipsters who love them--and their beer. Many menu items are variations on the sausage theme including the sausage platter which comfortably feeds two.Balthazar,New York,SoHo,It is never easy getting in but once you are at your table your cocoon the charms of Balthazar take over. The menu is much the same as always. Most of the best dishes are still there and so are the less successful items; highlights include the goat cheese tart the seafood platter the Balthazar salad steak frites and for dessert the tarte Tatin and the profiteroles. Balthazar is animated from early in the morning to late at night by diners who treat it like a brasserie rather than a sanctified restaurant. That atmosphere Í¢‘„‘î fake French authentic New York Í¢‘„‘î buoys the room. Craftbar,New York,Flatiron,Craftbar which Tom Colicchio opened at the beginning of 2002 to serve as Banana Republic to his more Prada-like Craft restaurant next door is a spare welcoming room serving simple comforting food.CafÍ—‘©cito,New York,East Village,CafÍ—‘©cito a sweet little restaurant on Avenue C was opened with the intention of offering authentic Cuban dishes tempered by contemporary American dietary customs. That is cooking techniques are lighter than is traditional and such flavorful additions as lard and pork fat are banished. The food is very good Í¢‘„‘î not great but enjoyable Í¢‘„‘î and the restaurant two adjoining storefronts that have been connected is always pleasant. Highlights include vaca frita flank steak marinated in mojo fried until its strands begin to separate into crisp tendrils and topped with pickled onions; and a fine traditional Cubano sandwich.Alta,New York,Greenwich Village,Alta is just about the smartest small-plate restaurant I have seen in New York: the elements of food wine and ambience all come together. The chef Harrison Mosher had been a sous-chef at 71 Clinton Fresh Food. His assignment was to create a menu of small plates using flavors and ingredients from around the Mediterranean and this he has done cleverly. Each meal at Alta was a natural unforced pleasure. Inevitably I imagine some people will complain about small portions. All I can say is they work for me.Wallse,New York,West Village,With Kurt Gutenbrunner the chef and owner of WallsÍ—‘© what you see is what you get and that carries over to his candid menu. And that among other reasons is why the restaurant continues to thrive despite a wealth of competitors creeping into the neighborhood. Not much has changed in the restaurant's decor and Mr. Gutenbrunner has also remained loyal to his menu. Once seen as a pioneer among chefs he has not been fazed by contemporaries like Ferran AdriÍ—‘_ and Thomas Keller.Landmarc,New York,TriBeCa,Nothing about Landmarc in TriBeCa is high concept. The space is comfortably dim which softens its industrial edges. The Chinese-restaurant-size menu reads like a studied survey of America's mainstream styles of cooking. Risotto and pastas mix with a section on mussels. Steaks are served with a choice of sauce. If you are in a bistro mood there is foie gras terrine and if you are hankering for American fare there is a grilled pork chop with spinach and apples. Its wine list includes a strong list of half bottles just the thing for a weeknight when you are out with friends in your favorite new neighborhood restaurant. Artichoke foam is all well and good but most of the time most of us would rather just have a thoughtful meal we can count on.BLT Steak,New York,Midtown East,BLT Steak (the initials stand for Bistro Laurent Tourondel) feels like anything but a steakhouse. On the communal table vases are packed with trimmed leeks and the banquettes are covered in buttery suede. Mr. Tourondel was the chef at Cello a restaurant on the Upper East Side that specialized in seafood. Here his focus is on meats in primal cuts. The hanger is by far the most flavorful. It is difficult to save room for dessert but you should.La Bottega,New York,Chelsea,The trattoria-style menu at La Bottega in the Maritime Hotel is long and populated with dishes that focus in Italian style on one or two ingredients. Fried artichokes with truffle oil. Fennel with blood orange. Prawns with sea salt. The choices are appealing yet numbing. It is a menu everyone has read before. Ravioli filled with butternut squash?  It's on there. Braised lamb with polenta? Check. Panna cotta? Of course. There are a few delights among the offerings but they cannot make up for the slough of irksome duds. At night La Bottega fills up mysteriously and the din can make it seem like a party in an empty swimming pool. But at lunch it is serene.Shanghai Pavilion,New York,Upper East Side,Shanghai Pavilion is not just sleek but inviting its cool modernistic black and red color scheme warmed by brick. The waiters wear ties the host a dark suit and the tables are covered in thick linens yet the service is pleasant and informal. And whether humble street snacks or elaborate banquet preparations the food is lively and balanced emphasizing the lightness and delicacy for which Shanghai cooking is known. Order the lion's head casserole with baseball-size pork dumplings soft enough to cut with chopsticks served in a savory soy broth with onions and greens. Red-cooked carp's belly in a tangy ginger and vinegar sauce is not as elaborate but no less delicious.La Nacional,New York,Chelsea,La Nacional a quirky cantina nestled into a storefront that serves as a gathering spot for Spanish expatriates has a bar tables for cards and a small rustic dining room which serves tapas and a few main courses. The doorway to the street is unmarked and as you enter a hallway and stand before an equally unmarked interior door it is possible to imagine you are stepping into a speakeasy. Main courses are simple enough: a chewy but flavorful steak a clutch of tiny lamb chops bathed in garlic and a soothing seafood casserole. The paella a dish that elsewhere often disappoints is as beautiful to look at in its pan as it is to eat. La Nacional understands the crucial point about paella that the rice is the single most important thing about the dish not the additions. If you want to linger listening to Spanish popular music or eavesdropping on another table debating politics you could do worse than a flan flavored with cinnamon and nutmeg. Junior's,Brooklyn,Park Slope,It's not the Four Seasons. Nor even an Odeon which has become a kind of La Coupole for the downtown Manhattan set. It's not even a Katz's with its thin-sliced deli meats and goofy charm. Those are all good places to eat. Junior's isn't really. Junior's is something else entirely although something great: a window into the Brooklyn of memory and the Brooklyn of now where there is no problem that cannot be solved by a dill pickle a hot twin roll with soft butter a freshener on your cup of coffee a fat slice of cheesecake a smile.Asiate,New York,Upper West Side,Dining at Asiate begins with a whoosh! as the elevator shoots up 35 floors to the restaurant's glassed-in perch overlooking Central Park. The design might be described as tundra luxe Í¢‘„‘î as if Philippe Starck and Mr. Cold Miser had collaborated. A sculpture affixed to the ceiling looks like a tangle of icicles and the bread plates resemble chips of pale blue ice. Nori Sugie Asiate's chef joins a wave of New York chefs fixated on Asian and French influences. The best present a synthesis of cuisines. Mr. Sugie's cooking however seems to have gotten muddled in the rarefied air. But when he does pull off the acrobatics it can be marvelous. Suckling pig is pressed its cheek confited and its trotters fried into a croquette. It's salty chewy earthy and rich.Agave,New York,West Village,The cuisine at Agave is billed as New Southwestern and it comes in handsome surroundings. The prevailing mood of calm and restraint ends with the menu which makes eating here an impetuous slightly mad adventure a blur of spices colors and textures Í¢‘„‘î the short ribs are a mountain of rich tender beef braised in mole colorado. The flops at Agave are unmistakable. Most of the salsas seem tired as does the ceviche of red snapper. Desserts too fall short. Otto Enoteca Pizzeria,New York,Greenwich Village,Otto is advertised as an enoteca and pizzeria which is more and less than the truth. There is a serious all-Italian list. There are also a lot of pizzas some traditional others unique to Otto and all cooked on top of the griddle rather than in an oven. The menu is devised ingeniously to stave off boredom with separate categories devoted to antipasti pizzas pastas cheeses and desserts. Otto has average pizzas good pizzas excellent pizzas and odd pizzas like the one topped with ricotta sliced potato and marinated anchovies. The pizza topped with lardo or cured salt pork is terrific. For dessert the gelati come plain and fancy including the stunning ricotta gelato with roasted figs.Szechuan Gourmet,Flushing,Flushing,Szechuan Gourmet serves food grounded in the regional flavor principles using plenty of chili and hot oil to achieve the spiciness known as 'la' and lots of Sichuan peppercorns to produce the flowery tingly sensation called 'ma.' The dining room is bright and pleasant. Food arrives fast and furiously without regard to the Western-style order of courses. If you are unfamiliar with the combination of ma and la there may be no better dish to sample than sliced beef tendon in hot sauce. The spiciness has dimension and flavor. The dumplings and wontons were doughy but dan dan noodles called noodles in meat sauce on the menu were fresh and forceful. Dry sautÍ—‘©ed green beans are superb.Peep,New York,SoHo,Stefan Boublil was told to make Peep a Thai restaurant &amp;quot;sexy.'' To him that meant voyeurism. His Apartment Design Group gave Peep peekaboo elements including a one-way glass wall in the bathroom which allows occupants to gaze into the restaurant. (Diners see a mirrored wall.) The 1989 movie ``Sex Lies and Videotape'' plays continuously in the bathroom.Jacques Torres Chocolate,Brooklyn,Fulton Ferry,Jacques Torres made his name in New York creating showoff desserts at Le Cirque. The mandate was clear: dazzle the customers by whatever means necessary. Hence the now-famous chocolate stove with moving parts. The fun and the showmanship often gave a false impression of Mr. Torres a classically trained pastry chef with a strong sense of tradition.The second Mr. Torres is on display at Jacques Torres Chocolate a small factory and retail shop that Mr. Torres opened after leaving Le Cirque and recently expanded adding retail space. The main business is chocolates which the shop supplies to restaurants and retail shops but Mr. Torres added a small counter and a couple of tables so that  customers could enjoy a hot chocolate and a pastry before getting down to the serious work of choosing their chocolates.  The pastries are more than a mild diversion. The croissants and petit pain au chocolat which are sold every day are scrupulously executed classics with the crunch the flakiness and the mouth feel that even the French have a hard time finding nowadays.Best of all is Mr. Torres's pithiviers the classic  puff pastry filled with almond cream named after the town of the same name near OrlÍ—‘©ans. It's available only on Saturdays when Mr. Torres turns out a few cakes and brownies almost by whim. It is better in fact than any pithiviers I ate in Pithiviers butter-rich with a crackling crust and a smooth almond cream inside with just the right balance between sweet salt and good clean almond flavor. It requires a trek to the Brooklyn waterfront. As the Michelin Guide likes to say it's worth the trip. Frankie &amp; Johnnie's,New York,Times Square Theatre District,A perennially packed steakhouse on 45th Street where the drinks are strong. Meyer Lansky no longer sits at the bar though you can occasionally find Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.Heidelberg,New York,Upper East Side,Heidelberg is swathed in history presenting its worn and faded face without touch-ups or apologies. With waiters in lederhosen chandeliers made of deer antlers and sturdy oil paintings dulled by decades of smoke Heidelberg is almost a stereotype of a German beer hall. Yet it is a friendly laid-back place and just right for hearty rib-sticking fare. Main course portions are typically enormous so the selection of appetizers is sensibly brief. They taste like afterthoughts too. Go directly to the entrees. The sauerbraten a tender beef roast redolent of vinegar and cloves is superb. Light and delicious spaetzle is available as a side dish. Beer is the preferred beverage with good German brands on tap. Desserts though are woeful.Taste Restaurant &amp; Wine Bar,New York,Upper East Side,AThere is every reason in the world to believe that if a chef's supply of fresh ingredients is always at hand his restaurant can serve simple well-executed food. nd that is what one expects at Taste the restaurant and wine bar carved out of Eli's the expensive fancy-food emporium on the Upper East Side. But the food is inconsistent: some nights it is respectable but uneven other nights it is over- or undercooked and generally underseasoned. What Taste has going for it is an excellent wine list whose prices are far more reasonable than the food's with a fine selection of wines by the glass. Maybe the best way to enjoy Taste is to sit at the bar and try out some of the wines by the glass with some of the excellent potato chips. Bennie's Thai Cafe,New York,Financial District,Bennie's Thai CafÍ—‘© sits at the basement corner of Fulton and Gold Streets. At lunch it serves as a kind of CafÍ—‘©teria for office workers spooning down curries at dinner as a kind of kitchen table for college students and neighborhood singles eating pad Thai. Very good pad Thai at that. The salads display the cook's rare talent. Try the sweet sausage and the grilled beef with Thai chili sauce. Entrees include curries made with a far thinner sauce than what's become standard at most Thai places but with no less flavor. There's also a triumphant house special of grilled Thai-style chicken served with a Thai take on plum sauce. For dessert a slice of baked acorn squash filled with squash custard hits a pleasant note. And like everything else at Bennie's it has the feeling and flavor of food cooked to a different standard than that of a restaurant: the home. Da Andrea,New York,Greenwich Village,After a young couple from Bologna took over Da Andrea revealed itself to be a dependably good local favorite one with ambition. Before anything order a plate of tigelle. It takes a while. It's a plate of thin warm biscuits fresh from the oven. You slice a biscuit open sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on the steaming bread fold some thin-sliced prosciutto onto one side close the covers and eat the melting flavors. The pastas are made daily and worth exploring as a shared appetizer or as a supper in themselves. The entrees are less assured. The lamb shank however is terrific. For dessert enjoy a plate of the kitchen's crunchy biscotti a glass of house-made limoncello and your memories of that artful tigelle.Esperanto,New York,East Village,Esperanto is a warm and welcoming place with Latin food that can be surprisingly subtle. Its main courses are sturdy and hard to mess up. Steak is good and beefy bathed in chimichurri the Argentine condiment of garlic and parsley; feijoada the Brazilian stew of black beans and smoked meats has a nice gritty texture and an almost yeasty flavor. The caipirinhas and mojitos are potent and the brief wine list features some good rustic reds. Don't miss the stellar coconut flan.Taqueria Y Fonda La Mexicana,New York,Upper West Side,Of the many simple Mexican restaurants that have opened in this part of the Upper West Side Taqueria is particularly interesting because of its extensive and unusual menu. Pork comes in a wonderfully complex chili ajo sauce with waves of smoky almost chocolate flavors. The sauce is better than the tough meat unfortunately and can be enjoyed just as well if you scoop it up with one of the soft warm tacos that come with the meal. The same is true with pork chops in a spicy vibrant sauce of tomatilloes cilantro and chilies and chicken in a smoky sauce of tomatoes and chipotle peppers. Tacos are first rate. Ali Baba,New York,Kips Bay,Ali Baba is a trove of Turkish street snacks centering on freshly baked Turkish breads. One of those snacks Lahmajun has actually been called Turkish pizza. The warm flat bread topped with savory ground lamb onions and chopped tomatoes is brightened with lemon juice. Eat it quickly or it loses its crispness though it will remain tasty. The same is true of pide (pronounced PEA-day) a thick dough the size of a small torpedo stuffed with tangy ground lamb or other fillings from cheese to sausage. Ali Baba also serves more conventional fare like a sparkling array of dips and spreads with puffy bread and the usual chops and kebabs. (Updated August 2010)Ali Baba's Terrace,New York,Midtown East,A sibling of Ali Baba a trove of Turkish street snacks on 34th Street (which was reviewed by The Times in 1999) this newer location has a lengthier menu that includes the same sparkling array of dips and spreads with puffy bread. Amy Ruth's,New York,Harlem,Amy Ruth's succeeds in presenting Southern food that manages to be up-to-date without sacrificing time-honored traditions. The waffles are wonderful crisp yet fluffy. The real stars of the menu though include short ribs that are falling-off-the-bone tender and baked spareribs served in a sweet barbecue sauce. Each main course comes with two side dishes and many of Amy Ruth's shine like buttery string beans served almost al dente. Pineapple-coconut cake is big and terrific. Tir Na Nog,New York,Midtown West,Irish cuisine beyond corned beef and cabbage. The menu includes old favorites like shepherd's pie and black pudding but there's a fresh new-Irish touch in the truffled potato-leek soup and the smoked salmon club sandwich on Irish brown bread. On weekends the restaurant serves a massive Irish breakfast which is not for the faint of heart.  Falafel House,New York,Upper East Side,This takeout shop has the predictable Middle Eastern menu with decenthummus baba gannouj and other dips exceptional fattoush (the tangyMiddle Eastern salad) and juicy flavorful kebabs. Steer clear of the dry falafel though. Zaytoons,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,Of the many moderately priced Middle Eastern restaurants around few offer the combination of genial relaxed surroundings and simple but meticulously prepared food that Zaytoons does. The soft pillowy baked-to-order pitas are perfect for scooping up cool salads and dips like tangy hummus; and excellent cucumber-and-yogurt salad with crumbled feta and plenty of refreshing mint. The pitas also form the basis of savory Middle Eastern pizzas and the terrific zatter bread baked just to the brink of crispness and served glistening with olive oil and fragrant with thyme salt and toasted sesame seeds. Kebabs are moist and succulent while basbousa a light semolina cake with honey and almonds makes a pleasing dessert.The Kosher Marketplace,New York,Upper West Side,The Kosher Marketplace a grocery on the Upper West Side with a nice selection of prepared foods takes  a conventional approach to kosher cooking. Side dishes are particularly good and would make great picnic fare.                        Carrot tsimmes ($5.95 a pound) simply grated carrots and raisins is sweetened with honey as is typical  yet the dish is refreshing rather than cloying. The same is true of mashed sweet potatoes  ($4.95 a pound)  tinged with cinnamon and also quite sweet. Summer potato salad ($3.95 a pound) is a brisk blend of chopped new potatoes with skins on red pepper strips and greens dressed with a vinaigrette.                         Main courses are not as consistently good. Barbecued chicken ($5.95 a pound) is dry and served with a sauce that is too heavy on the liquid smoke. That  sauce works much better with meaty chewy veal ribs ($8.95 a pound). Fried chicken ($5.95 a pound) is moist but the pleasantly oniony crust falls off the meat.  Cabbage stuffed with beef and rice ($8.95 a pound) is excellent though the sauce with  raisins is extremely sweet.  From the selection of classic Jewish desserts like babka mandelbrot  and kuchen I chose deliciously sweet noodle kugel  ($4.95 a pound). But beware the embedded maraschino cherries.  Le Zie,New York,Chelsea,This modest little trattoria offers some terrific Venetian dishes. Its beige walls are decorated with a few stencil designs while a wavy dropped ceiling hanging over a turquoise area of the dining room suggests the sea. Appropriately for a Venetian spot much of the food suggests the sea too. Striped bass fillet with fennel and white beans is moist and wonderfully flavorful. The chef has a sure hand with pastas like rigatoni with rosemary served al dente in a perfectly proportioned sauce.Uncle Nick's Greek Cuisine,New York,Clinton,Its fresh pristine fish and other Greek specialties have won Uncle Nick's Í¢‘„‘î a former hole in the wall that's expanded into a handsome taverna Í¢‘„‘î a devoted following. Appetizers are terrific. While the fish is always fresh too often it is overcooked and arrives dry. Make clear to the staff how you want it cooked.Chola,New York,Midtown East,Very good seriously intended Indian food served in uninspiring surroundings. The menu a kind of travelogue includes enticing sections devoted to southern Indian dishes from regions like Tamil-Nadu Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Kerala as well as Jewish specialties from Calcutta like lamb cooked in sweet and sour sauce with okra. Who knew? KaÍ—‘±a,New York,SoHo,Tapas are satisfying and traditional at this friendly lively bar. Boquerones anchovies pickled in a sweet-and-sour marinade are delicious; another good choice is tuna escabeche tender tasty cubes of fresh tuna marinated in citrus with fennel and served cool. Hot tapas don't stray from the traditional but they are lively and often prepared to order.Sparks Steak House,New York,Midtown East,Even within the two-fisted genre of New York steakhouses few places are as decidedly masculine as Sparks. Yet even though a dinner at Sparks brings out the raucous bond trader in even the mildest-mannered diner it all feels exactly right. The bar is crowded with people waiting for tables and there always seems to be a wait. The kitchen has been inconsistent in the past but when things are right the thick salt-crusted prime sirloins and lamb chops are superb. Stick with the steak house classics and take time to explore the superb wine list. Service is friendly but at times careless. Chimichurri Grill,New York,Clinton,If you're looking for a casual place for a good dinner before or after the theater you can hardly do better than this minuscule Argentine restaurant. Simultaneously sophisticated and homelike it combines all the elements that make the food of Argentina so appealing: great grilled beef a few Italian pasta dishes and some pure home cooking like the tortilla a frittata filled with potatoes chorizo and onions. You could easily eat the empanadas every day.Cho Dang Gol,New York,Koreatown,Cho Dang Gol serves uniquely rustic food that is very different from what is available at other Korean restaurants in the surrounding blocks. The specialty here is fresh soybean curd made daily at the restaurant. The kitchen makes each dish with extreme care. Even the panchan the little saladlike appetizers are of remarkably high quality. Instead of wine try beer so ju (Korean sweet-potato vodka) or makkolli (the rough milky rice liquor). Soba-Ya,New York,East Village,Noodles are the focus at this bright handsome little Japanese restaurant one of several nearby owned by the same group. The soba noodles Í¢‘„‘î buckwheat pale tan and smooth Í¢‘„‘î are served hot in soups or cold a better bet for appreciating their lightness and clear flavors. Appetizers are excellent differing night to night but sometimes including cooked marinated spinach rice with shreds of marinated sardines and fried squares of marvelously fresh tofu.Il Cantinori,New York,Greenwich Village,One of the original Tuscan trattorias but it's getting tired. The room is attractive but prices are high and the food is uneven. Sable's,New York,Upper East Side,The selection of smoked fish is terrific at Sable's a narrow store with barely enough room for people to line up at the counter. The owner Kenny Sze ran the smoked-fish department at Zabar's for a dozen years which explains not only his facility with smoked fish but also his mastery of New York deli-man patter. GaspÍ—‘© salmon and the milder Western-smoked salmon are fresh and pure and the lobster salad is wonderful.Vivolo,New York,Upper East Side,This venerable Italian restaurant in an East Side town house presents several dining options including a comfortable dining room a quicker more casual cafe and a takeout service where you can get simple lively dishes like spaghetti with olive oil and garlic and spezzatine di vitello a flavorful veal stew with peas carrots and sage over fat strands of bucatini.
