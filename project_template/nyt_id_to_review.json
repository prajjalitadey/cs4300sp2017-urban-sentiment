It is more than that though. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s also a  gallery of Thailand\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s bar snacks. Few items except for maybe the Vietnamese-style wings are substantial enough to be main courses. Still you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t a going-out-to-dinner kind of night but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers. \rPapa's Kitchen,Queens,Woodside,At Papa\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s Kitchen Beth Roa co-owner waitress and M.C. makes the rounds of tables gently proffering a karaoke microphone while in the kitchen her brother Miguel cooks serious Filipino comfort food. (Ms. Roa pitches in at the stove as needed.) The scent of roasted pork steals through the tiny room infiltrating clothes and hair. The menu is minimalist and mostly in Tagalog. Best to leave it up to the Roas and order the salu-salo sa bilao a feast of stupefying proportions presented in two winnowing baskets lined with banana leaves. \r\rKura,New York,East Village,At the sushi counter at Kura Norihiro Ishizuka stands alone with a benevolent and slightly rakish air white-grey hair peeking out of the bottom of his cap. No glass cases separate him from diners; instead fish is heaped unceremoniously in a wide shallow basket. Mr. Ishizuka hefts the fish up and slaps it back down as if assembling sushi were a purely practical matter not requiring a soundtrack by Philip Glass. He works the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand making sushi with substantial cuts of fish tricky to eat in a single bite but beautifully fresh.\rLake Pavilion,Queens,Flushing,Lake Pavilion is almost certainly New York\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner shimmering above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. The main dining room always looks as if a wedding were about to take place but most of the celebrating \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd birthdays and such \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd goes on in private rooms where the karaoke action can get heated. For the rest of us finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. The kitchen is serious about the Cantonese classics along with a few more recent notions from Hong Kong. \rDistilled,New York,TriBeCa,The mission statement that preceded one of my meals at Distilled (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWe are an American public house\\u201d) was slightly coy about the restaurant\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s ambitions. Yes there are wings onion rings and ribs but they are elevated by unexpected spices and technical flourishes like a tousle of dehydrated and shaved bacon on a B.L.T. The space is blandly handsome with dark woods and breathless ceilings. Service is remarkably friendly \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd hosts leap to open doors \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but the drinks are lady-killers elegant with a knife twist.\rEstela,New York,Nolita,You know what\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s coming within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room. You know that there will be a speech on how the menu works that most of the dishes will be small that sharing will be encouraged that the noise level will climb steeply that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. What takes you by surprise though is Ignacio Mattos\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s cooking. The food is almost familiar but not quite and it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s the little differences that get under your skin. Ingredients that don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t seem to have been tampered with often have an unexpected depth of flavor. The food has a mild case of strangeness that draws attention to how deep and elemental the flavors are. \rArmani Ristorante Fifth Avenue, New York,Midtown East,Armani Ristorante on the third floor of the Armani store on Fifth Avenue looks a little odd. It is reached by a private elevator from the street or better a sinuous white ramp that twists past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. Tiny blue and purple lights twinkle in the windows; white circular booths with black leather tops look like an Armani twist on the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World. But when the menu is at its best it takes its cues from the understated style of Milanese cuisine. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish has precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese shows up you just sit there smiling because you can tell from the gorgeous amber crust how much fun you are going to have eating it. The prices are stunningly expensive but they are in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service aren\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t as refined. \rGlasserie,Brooklyn,Greenpoint,Glasserie\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s chef Sara Kramer who spent time in the Marlow &amp; Sons empire diverges from the New Brooklyn model by reaching back to the Levantine spices of her Israeli heritage to create dishes that are at once artful and effortless. The restaurant at the northernmost tip of the Brooklyn waterfront is high-ceilinged but warrenlike with seating areas that feel like separate rooms and what may be the eeriest outdoor space in the city a terrace overlooking a dim cobblestoned internal courtyard \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd essentially a back alley through which every now and then a motorcycle roars.\rTaste of Persia NYC,New York,Flatiron,At Taste of Persia NYC a takeout counter tucked into a utilitarian pizzeria on 18th Street Saeed Pourkay serves his justly fabled ash reshteh a wondrous wintry outrageously thick Persian soup along with rustic stews that have been simmered for hours sometimes days. The food invokes the ancient splendors of the Spice Route but comes in ordinary plastic bins; forks and napkins must be foraged from the (very accommodating) pizzeria workers. In the back is a dining room with glaring fluorescents should you care to eat in.\r\rBetony,New York,Midtown,Bryce Shuman the chef of Betony worked under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park for six years and traces of Mr. Humm\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s style show up in his cooking. The refinement and focus are similar and so is the way that the signs of hard work have been tucked out of sight. Betony\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s food has been fussed over but it isn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t fussy. Mr. Schuman works with familiar flavors (roasted chicken; dry-aged short ribs; lobster with dill) but he gives them a clarity that can take you by surprise. The pleasure of his cooking isn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t exactly discovery. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s more like rediscovery. \rTake Root,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,Take Root on a drowsy block by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is an improbable enterprise. Three nights a week it turns into a restaurant with seats for 12 diners serving multi-course un-ascetic remarkable meals. The staff is comprised of a couple co-owners Elise Kornack the chef and Anna Hieronimus the host waitress and busser. But if the setup is homey the food is not. Ms. Kornack who was a sous chef at Aquavit cooks with skill ardor and imagination offering seasonally attuned dishes with a quiet questioning intelligence.\rLos Tacos No. 1, New York,Chelsea,Hatched by three entrepreneurial gents from the West (two from California one from northern Mexico) Los Tacos No. 1 is more or less engineered to serve as an oasis for all those West Coast transplants who are constantly complaining about the dubious quality of tacos in New York City. Bright and friendly the stand looks like a red white and black burger stand that you might have found alongside the Pacific Coast Highway circa 1955. The menu is limited but that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s how it should be. Deftly marinated and sliced from a flaming spit (imagine Mexican shawarma) the Tijuana-style adobada pork is the showpiece here. Get some of it inside a couple of hand-made corn tortillas and maybe a little more crammed into a quesadilla that has been dunked in hot oil. Help yourself to the sides \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u04d0_\ufffd_raw radishes charred green onions \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u04d0_\ufffd_and don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t scrimp on the salsa.\rThe Pines,Brooklyn,Gowanus,The Pines looks like an indie band sounds: dark moody a little uncomfortable cobbled together in a hurry and brimming with allusions. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky faded bunches of dried flowers and herbs hang upside down over the bar evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin in the woods being used for Wiccan rituals. Angelo Romano's cooking can be peculiar at times too and the menu changes so frequently it's hard to know just what you'll get. But Mr. Romano's originality and discerning eye for ingredients reward extra patience.\rTres Carnes,New York,Flatiron,It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s an alluringly simple idea: Take some Lone Star-quality barbecue (courtesy of a pitmaster who trained at the Salt Lick in Driftwood Tex. not far outside Austin) and put it into tacos and burritos. You\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_ll encounter an abundance of sides and fillings as you make your way down the Chipotle-style assembly line: two kinds of rice two kinds of beans roasted corn chipotle squash pickled onions guacamole. They\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_re all fine. But be disciplined and resist the urge to turn your tacos into Trapper Keepers of glop. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s up to you to let the smoke of the meat come through without too much interference especially when you opt for one of the restaurant\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s funky weekly specials which might involve pork belly or beef cheeks or roasted lamb. Taco stands rarely draw any ol\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds when it comes to dessert but the churro doughnut puffed around a sticky core of Mexican caramel qualifies here as a secret weapon.\rCostata,New York,SoHo,Michael White returns to the address in SoHo where he made his name when it was called Fiamma. Now he is an owner and the restaurant is a steakhouse but in a nod to old times Fiamma\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s garganelli with truffle cream is on the menu along with other dishes that show his mastery of fresh pasta. As at Marea his seafood palace on Central Park South there is a crudo section most of it very appealing. The steaks and chops are hit or miss but the veal chop is everything you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_d want from that cut and the bone-in rib-eye for two called the Costata is a reason for this restaurant to exist all by itself. \rOda House,New York,East Village,Oda House on a subdued corner of Alphabet City may be the first restaurant in Manhattan to capture the inclusive and at times shambolic spirit of Georgian restaurants in southern Brooklyn. Seats are filled with vast families young women dressed in black from shoulder to mid-thigh and older women who occasionally lean over to the young women\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd_s tables to dispense advice. The chef Maia Acquaviva was a plastic surgeon in Georgia before coming to New York and redirecting her knife skills. Her dishes draw on the vivid herbs and spices that characterize cooking along the former Silk Road in Central Asia including Georgian saffron otherwise known as marigold poised irresolutely between bitter and sweet; tarragon believed to have been originally uprooted from Siberia and brought west by the Golden Horde; and utskho suneli the dried seeds of blue fenugreek used as a spice almost nowhere else in the world. Variations on khachapuri the legendary Georgian flatbread with guts of melted cheese are too salty too cheesy and spectacular.\rMP Taverna Astoria,Queens,Steinway,MP Taverna offers Michael Psilakis\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s second-generation melting-pot vision of an America where Greek flavors have been woven into the fabric of American cooking so thoroughly that they\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_re taken for granted. In this America nobody is surprised when a \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdroasted lemon chicken\\u201d with satisfyingly crisp skin is sauced with rich avgolemono and threads of fresh dill. Dense white cubes of feta pickled in wood barrels are widely recognized as an appetizer that can hold its own with burrata. Tender gigantes are a natural addition to mussels neatly arranged in a skillet. And cooks who rely on the salty porky charms of sausage are apt to round out a dish with caul-wrapped sheftalia a favorite in Cyprus or loukaniko made at MP Taverna with leeks and orange peel.\rSpice Symphony,New York,Kips Bay,Spice Symphony specializes in a subset of Indian cooking \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd traceable back to Kolkata\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s Chinatown and hugely popular across the subcontinent \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd that gleefully appropriates Chinese flavors to strange and often wondrous ends. Where American Chinese food tends to the sweet and vapid with all the interesting bits buffed out Indian Chinese is hotter and more motley playing up the cuisines\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_ differences rather than seeking common ground. This is a shift in style for the chef Walter D\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Rozario who took a more elevated approach in his previous post as chef de cuisine at Junoon. There Mr. Rozario might have bundled spices into a bouquet garni to be neatly disposed of before plating; at Spice Symphony he throws in whole spices for a more rustic texture. (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThis is grandmotherly cooking\\u201d he explained.) There are elegant renditions of classic Indian dishes as well and a thoughtful selection of wines by the glass; now if only the front of the house didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t fall to pieces in the face of crowds.\rABC Cocina,New York,Flatiron,The menu a collaboration of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Dan Kluger rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in Europe (that would be Spain) Central America and South America (although you don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t need to go to Argentina these days to find chimichurri). This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones.\rFeast,New York,East Village,The concept behind Feast is to find the midpoint between the ever more esoteric tasting menus that have proliferated around town and the humble satisfactions of a smorgasbord. Accordingly there are three \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdfeasts\\u201d each consisting of eight dishes (plus dessert) revolving around a particular group of ingredients \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffdIron Chef\\u201d-style delivered not in stately progression but four at once on plates set at the center of the table like a private buffet. These gently priced prix fixes can seem generous if you choose a good one and a bit of a grift if not. The chef Chris Meenan was chef de cuisine at Veritas and his background in haute American cooking asserts itself in small elevating details. But at times it seems that he can\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t decide whether dishes should be precisely composed or sprawl. The space itself is warm and inviting ideal for the large gatherings the restaurant hopes to entice. If its rustic references are familiar \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd barn pulleys repurposed as light fixtures tarnished mirrors dish towels subbing for napkins \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd they still appeal.\rDaniel,New York,Upper East Side,Daniel serves exquisitely sensitive profoundly seasonal fundamentally French cooking. The excellence of the ingredients and the kitchen\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s talent for unlocking all they have to offer can be startling although at times they can be embedded in elaborate multipart compositions that don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t fully reward the attention they demanded. But the attention to detail is unparalleled as in the basket of gorgeous breads the cheese cart (one of the finest four-wheel vehicles in New York) the desserts and the warm madeleines which are revealed when a server pulls back the folds of a napkin as if they were petals on a rose. The service can be among the best in the city with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness but it is not always that way for everyone. \rMamak House,Queens,Flushing,Malaysian restaurants in New York tend to favor Peranakan or Straits Chinese cuisine. Mamak House (pronounced \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdmama\\u201d with a silent K) focuses on the cooking of the Mamak community \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Malaysians with Indian Muslim roots \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd on the island of Penang. The chef Nani Yusof Hughie grew up in Penang\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s capital George Town and her heritage like that of the city is a braid of cultures: Tamil Punjabi Chinese Thai and Dutch. While the dishes on the menu may sound familiar in flavor they lean more toward India than China which means they are spicier and less sweet and a revelation. The dining room has an unfinished air with defunct tabletop grills and exhaust hoods left over from the Korean barbecue joint that previously occupied the space.\rCherry,New York,Chelsea,It is hard not to feel vexed at Cherry which promises so much and proves such a tease. The mostly Japanese intermittently French restaurant owned by Jonathan Morr (also behind BondSt) and Eugene Morimoto occupies a subterranean space in the Dream Downtown hotel in the meatpacking district. The room is very dark and very red the lamp shades crinkled like garters the walls sheathed in brocade. There are glimpses of what the chef Andy Choi previously at Le Cirque and M\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd P\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_che can do \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a delicate madai carpaccio rosy with umeboshi (pickled plum) and strewn with puffed-rice-cracker pearls; gyoza swollen with short rib and foie gras and dappled with sour cherries and a plum sake reduction \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but the kitchen is prone to excesses of salt and sweetness and the sushi suffers from that cardinal sin over-vinegary rice. There are consolations to be found in the deep sake list and the excellent desserts. The bill however is a cruel anticlimax.\rNightingale 9,Brooklyn,Carroll Gardens,Nightingale 9 is named after a defunct telephone exchange associated not with the restaurant\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s neighborhood Carroll Gardens but with the borough\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s farther-flung less gentrified southeastern quarter. So too the chef Robert Newton \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd who was born in Arkansas and runs the Southern restaurant Seersucker a few doors down \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd borrows flavors across a distance finding resonances between the cooking of Vietnam and that of his heritage. Certain dishes loyal to their origins astonish but elsewhere the hard work in the kitchen doesn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t quite pay off. Fortunately adjustments can be made with the condiments provided among them Bluegrass soy sauce micro-brewed in Kentucky; nuoc cham made with Red Boat fish sauce from Phu Quoc Island Vietnam; and an emphatic house-made hot sauce of raw bird chiles. More canteen than restaurant Nightingale 9 is an appealingly rough-at-the-edges place to be with concrete floors walls of skim-coated brick and paint-splotched metal chairs arranged around communal tables. Chopsticks rest on clothespins a homey notion that Mr. Newton picked up down South while numbers stenciled on the walls are a nod to the table numbers typically found in hole-in-the-wall pho shops. \rUncle Boons,New York,Nolita,This dark woody half-underground Thai pub serves some of the freshest and most dynamic Thai flavors in the city. At one end of the bar by the entrance is a motorized ice bucket that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. At the other is a kitchen window showing off a rotisserie and a charcoal grill where baby octopus and blowfish tails sizzle and pop. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThai-style drinking food\\u201d is the ostensible theme but there are deeply aromatic curries and home-style cooking too. The owners and chefs Ann Redding and her husband Matt Danzer met while working at Per Se and the service has more Keller-esque finesse than you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_d expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAnother Brick in the Wall\\u201d and \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHang on Sloopy.\\u201d\rHunan Manor,New York,Murray Hill,Hunan food is often overshadowed by that of Sichuan perhaps because it traffics in unmitigated heat without the tempering sweetness or the pins and needles along the tongue that come with Sichuan cuisine. And while notable Sichuan restaurants are now strung through lower Midtown Manhattan like a ring of fire Hunan Manor just south of Grand Central Terminal remains a bit of an outlier. In a comradely way the menu includes a few Sichuan classics along with two pages of American Chinese food thoughtfully segregated up front the easier to skip over. Trust in any dish with the words \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdpreserved\\u201d or \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdsour\\u201d in its name like preserved beef nearly black and chewy as toffee scattered among yellow-white skins of once-green chile peppers that have been blanched and sun-dried until leached of color and sour string beans diced to the size of wedding bands and heaped with minced pork and funnels of red chile pepper. The restaurant is a family operation owned by Alan Li and his sister Diana Li (who also run Hunan House in Flushing Queens) and Nancy Xiao a cousin. All are natives of Hengyang city in Hunan province as is the chef Zhi Jun Long.\rLafayette,New York,NoHo,Lafayette is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery a cocktail bar an all-French wine list and a rotisserie where chickens slowly give up their melting fat to potatoes and onions roasting below. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts. As for the food there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone. \rCasa Enrique,Long Island City,Long Island City,Cosme Aguilar the chef of Casa Enrique was born in Chiapas the southernmost state in Mexico but has spent much of his professional life cooking French food. Here he brings polish to Mexican classics without tampering with their essence. One distinctively Chiapan dish pork ribs suffused with cinnamon allspice fruity guajillo chiles and a housemade pineapple vinegar left to ferment for three months makes you wish there were more offerings on the menu from this region underrepresented among New York\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s Mexican restaurants. But Mr. Aguilar\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s upbringing took him across Mexico and his menu ranges accordingly. He approaches the food not as a scholar but as a native speaker. Elsewhere in town higher-profile chefs who came to Mexican food later in life are embracing it as their own; at Casa Enrique Mr. Aguilar is experiencing a kind of homecoming. \rKajitsu,New York,Murray Hill,To express wonder that Kajitsu\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s chef Ryota Ueshima can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour butter sugar and eggs. Kajitsu practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin-ryori that was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries over many centuries and when the Japanese have have been working on an idea for hundreds of years they tend to figure a few things out. But it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s still possible to be surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima can coax out of meals that westerners would call vegan. \rLos Perros Locos,New York,Lower East Side,Los Perros Locos translates as mad dogs a fair description of the house specialty: hot dogs in the ornate Colombian style in which dog (all-beef chorizo or for an infinitesimal decrease in debauchery vegetarian) and bun (split-top like a lobster roll and sweet from King\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s Hawaiian) are subsumed by an avalanche of toppings. More strictly Colombian dogs are offered at three tiers of escalating complexity alongside wilder improvisations such as the Pablo Escobar named after the notorious drug lord of Medell\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_n and mounded with an off-white snow that the menu identifies as perico Spanish slang for cocaine. (It proves to be merely Cotija cheese.) The disco font on the signage starts to make sense. This is nocturnal tired-wired food for when your defenses are down. You eat it the same way you dance to that vapid song of the summer horrified at yourself looking over your shoulder to make sure no one\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s watching.\rMontmartre ,New York,Chelsea,The pot au pho and other French-Asian fusion dishes at Montmartre often have more conviction than the straight-up French food of many other New York bistros. Seats in the two dining rooms (a tiny one downstairs a slightly less tiny one upstairs) are so close together that you can find yourself playing Twister with servers who are simply trying to clear your plate. But the place has energy. The walls are covered with photographs: some are rowdy some cooly elegant; many were shot in Paris and others in New York. The images don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t seem to belong together but like the cooking they converse intercontinentally. \rCarbone,New York,Greenwich Village,At Carbone they don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t ask if you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_ve dined with them before. Even if you haven\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t Italian. It is a fancy red-sauce joint as directed by Quentin Tarantino taking a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured a little embarrassing beneath the notice of serious people and bringing back its the punch-in-the-gut thrills. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy a lust for excess that can at times make you a little queasy and an instinct for sheer entertainment that can make a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest unimaginative drones.\rMaison Premiere,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,When Maison Premiere first opened in Williamsburg it was an exercise in mood (louche) and epoch (French Quarter circa the 1890s). Primarily a bar it served little more than absinthe and oysters. This was enough; everyone wanted in. But apparently the owners Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka want to be loved for more than good looks. A proper kitchen has been built in the basement and the menu expanded under the chef Lisa Giffen. Her food is impressionistic best appreciated as a series of lovely fleeting moments rather than the sustained arc that typically constitutes a meal: sea scallop with rosy pickled rhubarb and a drift of shaved horseradish ice hot and cold at once; Spanish mackerel charred before being steeped in a citrus escabeche; turbot and clams basted in seaweed butter and immersed in a chowder afloat with impeccably round potato orbs. A practical note: do not attempt to enter between the hours of 4 and 7 p.m. when oysters are $1 each and the crowd restless. Later you will still wait but at least with hope. \rSakaMai,New York,Lower East Side,SakaMai is a Japanese restaurant filtered through an American consciousness respectful of tradition but not bound by it. The chef Takanori Akiyama is a native of Japan who has long incorporated Western elements in his cooking. Some dishes like dried and broiled skate wings still threaded with cartilage are excellent examples of izakaya food; others \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd like sea urchin and sturgeon caviar layered over loose scrambled eggs simmered at low temperature in the French style \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd aspire in their fragility and miniaturist proportions to the precision of kaiseki. SakaMai does not commit to one genre of Japanese cuisine. It is an inclusive place gentle on neophytes. The sake list is smart without being too scholarly a good counterpoint to the esoteric cocktails whih feature ingredients like wasanbon a Japanese sugar kneaded by hand and the scent of scorched cloves and cinnamon trapped in a snifter and released at the table. The d\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdcor is understated: sheer white curtains votives eroded brick. Tucked in the back is a semi-secret den complete with a fireplace and a kilim.\rSalvation Taco,New York,Murray Hill,When a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes too few of the tacos at this jammed and noisy restaurant inside the Pod a new hotel in Murray Hill. The tortillas slightly bigger than an English muffin can be topped so mimimally and sauced so timidly that they are overwhelmed by the taste of masa. Those tiny portions can cool quickly too. The best way to get a taco at Salvation is to roll your own from a \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdfamily-style feast\\u201d impressive platters of protein that come with a covered basket of warm and fragrant tortillas.\rTaqueria Tlaxcalli,The Bronx,Parkchester,The exterior with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long eventful night tells you to move on. The interior with mango-colored walls lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights tells you to stay. The menu includes tacos tortas gorditas sopes and molcajetes all prepared with fidelity to the spirit of Mexico City\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s taquerias.\rBunker,Ridgewood Queens,Ridgewood,This scuffed yellow storefront with a floral-plaid ruffle in the window across from a 24-hou", "1418": "There are only a few things at \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd21\\u201d that one can order with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd21\\u201d burger and the coconut cake topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut. But to judge \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd21\\u201d as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like Galatoire\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s in New Orleans \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd21\\u201d is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling but: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdCan I get you something to drink?\\u201d On a good night everybody who works at \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd21\\u201d behaves like a bartender and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. ", "1419": "No other restaurant in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply when it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Under the relentless guidance of Eric Ripert the executive chef and Maguy LeCoze his partner in the business Le Bernardin moves forward without resting. After dining room redesign in 2011 the interior walks in step with the cuisine: up-to-date lively intimate and playful.", "1420": "Seasonal a warm Austrian-German bistro combats a gloomy Midtown location with toasty pumpkin-seed oil elderflower syrup veal-cheek goulash and many different house-made noodles and dumplings.

Women in French maid outfits serve the stuff as if they were characters in an early Preston Sturges film. And you know what? It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s terrific.The model is an old one although new to New York. There are L\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdtes in Paris and London in Bahrain and Barcelona. The first was established in Paris in 1959 in what had been a Venetian-themed restaurant called naturally Le Relais de Venise. The founder was a winemaker Paul Gineste de Saurs who thought having a restaurant might help build a market for the grapes his family had been growing for centuries.Le Relais de Venise did not flourish on the strength of its wine list however. Lacking restaurant experience M. Gineste de Saurs had limited ambition. He thought only to offer a salad to start and then a grilled cut of sirloin the French call entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdte (and which we call strip steak) with a rich buttery sauce and a copious amount of fries.He took no reservations; you simply showed up and were seated. Those decisions turned out brilliantly. They were an assault on the tyranny of choice. The restaurant was instantly called by its meat name not its geographical one: L\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdte. Lines formed and have been there ever since even as the family has broken into parts and opened slightly different franchise versions of the restaurant all over the world.There is no queue yet at the New York outpost of L\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdte though like the others it takes no reservations. The room is too large perhaps for the neighborhood\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s large transient market. But business has been growing. The plural of anecdote is not data but visits over the past eight weeks have seen a more crowded dining room each time. &amp;quot;It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s getting better&amp;quot; a waitress said one recent night. &amp;quot;It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s building.&amp;quot;That is grand. Customers enter the room a brightly colored rectangle near Lexington and 52nd and it spreads south and west before them. Not very good paintings of Venetian scenes adorn the walls in that peculiar French manner that combines bad taste with deep sophistication.

(There are no men in L\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdte\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s universe at least in the dining room.)

It is a pile the size of a softball mixed green and red lettuces draped in a mustardy vinaigrette that in early days here was nearly as thick as a mayonnaise. Lately it has thinned out into something closer to silk. Walnuts are strewn across the top rich and oily. It all goes fast leaving smiles.Your steak comes in two stages on a relatively small plate: you eat your portion of meat sauce and fries and then are served seconds. The beef is fine sliced thin across the grain and as tender as cheap meat gets a perfect midweek dinner with a friend. The fries rate higher on the crazy-good scale: salty and crisp with tender interiors that aren\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_t mushy even when soaked in the sauce.On the subject of that sauce much has been written. Little is known. To its credit the restaurant keeps the ingredients secret. It is perhaps a variant on the gravy poured out at Caf\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd de Paris in Geneva since the 1940s: butter basically infused with herbs and mustard and cream with a metallic tang of chicken liver running right through its middle. Whatever it is at L\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_Entrec\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdte you could pour the stuff over a boot and still have an excellent dinner.Would you like some more? Those seconds are kept warm on racks that sit above votive candles at service stations set throughout the dining room.

Yvon de Tassigny the restaurant\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_s chef has matched great live-fire technique to excellent groceries and reveals himself to be a master of off-cut lamb and beef. And his iceberg salad served below warm bacon vinaigrette that melts a scattering of blue cheese across its top and softens the exterior of the crisp lettuce is among the great things to eat on the north side of Williamsburg Brooklyn. Marvelous lamb is one good reason to come but the steaks are quite good as well as is the pork chop and Mr. de Tassigny is no slouch when it comes to mackerel trout or scallops either. There is no pastry chef and it shows but this is no terrible matter at these prices and the room is pleasant and warm. ", "1795": "Now dinner and a movie is easier.

Other dishes are distinguished by the conscientious approach of the kitchen. The pimento cheese toast that is part of a 'sample plate' (also including a beet-pickled egg a deviled egg and a pile of country ham shavings) is better than most because the kitchen makes it from scratch with Grafton Cheddar cheese and freshly roasted peppers. And the fried chicken is good. So good I watched a Southern-born friend devour nearly two whole portions in one sitting.

Fish and chips is as emblematically British as it gets; Spike Hill's version is perfectly executed.
