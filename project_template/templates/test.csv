182177,Allerton,"Our first airbnb stay and we felt very comfortable dealing with Christian. His place was nice and clean and pre-trip communications were regular. Read all Christian's other reviews/see his accurate pictures and you will have an excellent idea what you are getting in the Bronx.

Other than what has already been said, I asked about the efficiency of the one window A/C unit in only the bedroom and was pleased to find a second window unit in the living area when we arrived. It was 95 degrees when we were there and the A/C kept us nice and cool. Thanks to Christian for making our inaugural airbnb experience a great one! "
3429765,Allerton,"Simply put, I couldn't have stayed with a nicer person.  Pat was very helpful, interesting to talk to, and the room and shared space she provided were comfortable and spotlessly clean.

1578776,Ditmars Steinway,"I loved New York!  My stay couldn't have been better and Beatrix was the main reason why I had such a great time.  She showed me around and took good care of me.  There were places I wouldn't have known about or things I could do would it not be for her.  I only wish I had more time for my trip!  If you're traveling solo, this is a great place to stay!"
8741446,Ditmars Steinway,"Freda is great! She welcomed us and showed us the neighborhood.  The apartment is clean and you have everything you need. Lovely neighborhood, 5min walk to the subway and 15min with the subway to Manhattan. We felt safe and secure at all time.  Although it is a pretty quiet place for new york you have a lot of good restaurants and supermarkets within a few minutes walk. We definitely recommend this for your trip to NYC!"
4376618,Ditmars Steinway,"The appartement and the room were very clean and the same as in the picture and description. Very near to the station which was 20-25 min from the center! The only thing was we never met Katarina even if she was at home and the communication by mail wasn't always easy. Anyway our stay in her flat was still very pleasant and very calm, the room(lounge, kitchen, bathroom,bedroom) are not decorated but really spacious! Also you have everything around ! "
6611592,Ditmars Steinway,"The flat was exactly as described, it is so modern and was extremely clean. The rafik's flat is very nice located in a quiet street. Only 20 minutes away from Manathan. 
Thanks again Rafik!"
4211510,Ditmars Steinway,"Overall, I had a very nice stay. The neighborhood was safe, 10 minute walking distance from subway and near plenty of good food. The air conditioning worked well and the room was basic, but comfortable. Funda responded quickly and was helpful. She also provided towels and shampoo. I would definitely stay here again, although, I would bring my own sheets-- I wasn't 100% sure they were clean. Either way, I slept great. Bottom line: $50 (ish) a night for a safe room in NYC... I'll take it!"
11624694,Ditmars Steinway,"Appartement parfaitement adapté pour decouvrir la ville a l'aide du métro situé à proximité ! Frankie est tres accueillant et s'est renseigné plusieurs fois si nous étions bien logés et ne manquions de rien. L'appartement est plutôt bien équipé, il manque cependant une hotte de cuisine (lorsque nous cuisinions nous avons déclenché l'alarme incendie plusieurs fois). Le quartier est animé (bars, restaurants) mais la rue de l'appartement est calme. Le seul véritable inconvénient était le chauffage trop fort. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez frankie !! "
6441936,Ditmars Steinway,"Jim and Nicole were wonderful hosts and their place in Queens is exactly as described, clean, spacious and conveniently located close to the subway. They were very friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything. Also, they are just super interesting people to get to know. 

Thanks for everything!"
2756886,Ditmars Steinway,I didn't meet Funda. She did allow me to keep my bags in the front foray after check out and come back and get them later which was great. 
6032118,Ozone Park,It was an amazing experience! Israel was a great host. He made my stay an eventful one. The proximity to the subway was too convenient. 
15008979,Ozone Park,"This home could not have been better suited to my needs, I only required it for 2 nights but the hosts are extremely friendly. There is a private mini-fridge in the bedroom stocked with drinks and snacks, it was a welcome surprise. The location was very urban, but the surrounding neighborhood was easily accessible with the nearest train stop only a 5 minute walk away. There is a permanent family that is living in this home, just as a fair warning, but they are very nice and constantly made sure I was comfortable. Overall a very homey experience, and I would recommend this lodging to anyone who is in need!"
8135403,Arverne,Lilanie's and her husband had extremely warm and very friendly attitude towards I and my sister. They are both very lovely couple. A nice and very clean house. We stayed there as we wanted to be close to the airport to skip the traffic but out of all (8) Airbnb experiences I had this was the one I will remember the most. For a moment we both felt like we were home. Thanks for everything Lilanie. 
13752815,Arverne,"New and everything worked; except the Wifi.

Strategically close to the beach, which was exactly what I needed for my kids.

We were ok with the noise by mainly the trains; although some may find it disturbing."
7894007,Arverne,"D was a great host, and the place was awesome. She was very patient while answering all of my question. The apartment was very close to the beach, comfortable, and super clean. "
11060749,Astoria,"Great place, was very happy"
3615796,Astoria,"Jason was the perfect host and his apartment was so clean and comfortable, it had everything we needed and more, all appliances etc were of excellent quality. What a great neighbourhood, we had fun exploring and finding great restaurants and always felt very safe, even at night. Very easy walking distance to 3 different subway stations, it was the perfect place for us and an excellent airbnb introduction.. we would highly recommend this property and would love to stay here again one day!!"
74680,Astoria,"Nazleen and Daniel were great hosts! Nazleen met us upon arrival and was prompt to respond to questions we had during our stay. The neighborhood is visibly on the up and up, but not one I felt very comfortable walking through at night with my teenaged daughter. The space fit the pictures and description well and since we had great weather during our stay, we got to enjoy the patio a bit!"
14240385,Astoria,This room was very comfortable and clean. The host was very nice. The location was very convenient and right off of the train line! Would definitely recommend the room to anyone traveling to NY!
8952816,Astoria,"I would definitely come back here again when I stay in NY next time!! This is the perfect place to stay during your travel. I love the atmosphere and the tasteful room made me feel as if I had been somewhere in Europe. (You have to carry the luggage to the second floor by using stairs, but it is no big deal.) The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is peaceful and quiet, and there is a nice park where many children play on the way to the subway station. The good point is it is easy to get to Manhattan by subway. Lolita always texted me back so quickly when I had problems or questions. When I needed to book a taxi, she kindly gave me some information. The lady who keeps the kitchen and bathroom always clean was also kind. I met her several times and she was very friendly. I was so glad that I spend nice time there and will never forget this amazing trip in NY. I hope I can visit there soon in the future! Thank you :^)"
761835,Astoria,"i love Lucas's apartment  ! And Lucas's is the best host I have ever seen! he is very cooperative , kind helpful and hospital ! staying in his apartment made me feel at home ! He also invited me to his birthday party ! that was a fantastic experience ever , he makes me love New York more! I strongly recommend his apartment ! Clean ! Spacious ! Good location and with all the amenities that a guest might need ! "
2141549,Astoria,"Eden and Niki (her husband) are very kind and friendly people, they are respectful and always available to help and respond to any questions guests may have, the apartment is very clean and very comfortable, very close to the subway, also located in a very safe neighborhood, there are bars and restaurants nearby.
I recommend the apartment at 100%, I would return to this apartment easily

7325889,Astoria,"Hi,
as a first timer in NewYork, I'm guessing the rooms are smaller and crimpy.
the place was on the 3 floor and someone carrying with big suitcases should think twice since the place doesn't have a lift."
645693,Astoria,"Daniel's apartment is great. The Location is excellent,  Subway very close and you can travel To Manhattan in justo a few minutes. There are a lot of restaurants near by ( sushi, pizza, fast food, starbuck's, etc) Bazaar supermarket is just 2 blocks away. 
You have everything near by
Defenitely will stay here for my next trip"
1036498,Astoria,Very comfy bed and perfect location within one block or less from anything one could need. Thank you Daniel & Nancy. I will recommend you to friends. 
7664789,Astoria,Needed it for the night and it was fine. 
11992103,Astoria,"Paul is very nice and the place is wonderful. It's convenient (close to the subway station), and I'm very satisfied with the kitchen, clean and with complete functions. The sofa bed is full size and Paul served a mattress for comfort. I really had a great time staying here. Thank you Paul!"
978386,Astoria,"We had an AWESOME time staying at Yiota's place in Queens. Although we didn't get to meet Yiota personally, we interacted with Kyri multiple times and he was very helpful and accomidating. He suggested the Queens Kickshaw, and we ate lunch there on our final day and loved it! Since this was my first trip to NYC, staying in Austoria gave me the true feeling of living in the city. I would love to live there :). We took the subway everywhere and there's multiple stations nearby. We also visited the Bagel's and Brew shop just a few doors down for coffee and breakfast several times. This apartment is just a 20 minute subway ride into Manhattan and other top spots in the city. The neighborhood is very safe and there is lots to do without even leaving the neighborhood. I can assure you that our next trip to NYC will be centered around when we can book this apartment! (We plan to come back in 2014 since they are bringing Les Miserables back to Broadway!) If you are coming to NYC with the hopes of feeling like you're really living there, this is the spot to stay! We loved it that much. Thanks again Yiota and Kyri! "
8954037,Astoria,"Room was OK. Clean. Bathroom clean. Easy access to the room.  Although bedding was different color. Other guests were loud at night and early in the morning in the kitchen. Never met Lolita. 
Great location."
3768977,Astoria,"The listing description was very accurate and the pictures accurately portrayed the apartment. The neighborhood was very nice and it was quiet for sleeping. The apartment was so cute and cozy.   Ehsan had so many thoughtful touches to the apartment for example the umbrella in the closet, some condiments and staples in the cabinets and shampoo in the bathroom. The apartment was very clean and updated. The apartment was also clearly marked and easy to locate. We would definitely stay in this apartment again if we have the opportunity.   Linda and Rick "
1763209,Astoria,"It was our first time using airbnb and what an incredible experience! They welcomed us in kindly, always gave the right advice at the right moment, the neighbourhood was great (safe, a big supermarket around the corner, 10 min to Manhattan with the Metro), the appartment is filled with cool stuff (sometimes we simply found ourselves looking at the artwork), their dog is super friendly, there are also lots of eating possibilities in Astoria. Both are vibrant, active and charismatic characters that represent the true spirit of NY and are the golden key to the city-

To sum up: if you are looking for a home base in New York to discover Manhattan from and want to meet some great people along the way, this is definitely it"
14868703,Astoria,"Staying with Juliana was one of my easiest and most hospitable host experiences to date! Her communication for check-in and throughout the stay was awesome, even while she was away. The guest spaces were accurately described, full of helpful Travel minis/amenities, and squeeky clean. The bedroom was cozy (on the small side, but typical for NY), but quite comfortable.  The apartment's proximity to the metro stop (15 mins to Time Square max), bodegas, and Astoria's bars/restaurants make it a convenient place for those wishing to visit Manhattan daily, but sleep somewhere more peaceful. I would recommend Juliana's place to friends!"
7803602,Astoria,Everything was as described and the flat was clean. Thanks!
6042555,Astoria,Sue's place is great! Few mins to metro and lots of restaurants and supermarket right on the corner. The bed is comfortable and the room is clean. And the neighborhood is safe. It was quite a nice experience to stay with her!
531091,Astoria,Dragan was a great host. A really nice guy. The appartment was nice and clean and had recently been painted.  It's located a couple of minutes away from the subway station and it only takes around 15 minutes to get to times square.  The Astoria area is safe and has a nice chilled out vibe. There are plenty of cool bars and restaurants within walking distance of the appartment and prices are much cheaper than Manhattan. Definitely worth having some nights out in Astoria.
1214086,Astoria,"The apartment was clean, close to the subway and at a good location. Yusnier was flexible with checking in and out and quick to answer questions. We loved our stay at this place, really worth the money!"
3833207,Astoria,"Accueil très chaleureux de la part de Marie. Appartement très bien situé (métro à 3min, commerces/restaurants dans le quartier). Déco sympa, logement très propre et conforme à l'annonce. 
Nous recommandons chaudement !"
9462208,Astoria,"Kelly has a great apartment in historically Greek Astoria.  It's an easy 5 minute walk to the N train and from there about a 15 minute subway ride to Times Square.  Everything in the apartment was lovely, organized, decorated well and there was more than enough room for the 4 people traveling in our party. The neighborhood was great and we felt safe even when coming home late at night.  Once more, upon checking in Kelly made sure to provide us with a list of interesting things nearby, including: recommended restaurants, museums and things of that nature.  She even made sure to follow up with us concerning her internet, which had recently been turned on. 

Honestly, I don't think we could have found a better place for our stay in NYC.  The location was close to the heart of things, in a safe area I don't think a lot of people see, with a lot of restaurants near by.  The apartment was immaculately decorated and felt like a real home.  And finally, it was far less expensive than anything we could have found via a hotel.  For the money, I think it's probably the best place to stay in NYC. 

***Highly Recommended!***"
151199,Astoria,"Excellent accueil. Gladys est très présente pour nous conseiller en cas de moindre problème. Le métro est à 300 m et mène à Times square en 15 minutes.
Des magasins de commodité a proximité.
Un espace cuisine avec bouilloire, four micro ondes, un toaster et un frigo
Gladys nous a même gentiment préparé une collation comme accueil ce qui fut fort agréable avec de longues heures de voyage."
14872445,Battery Park City,"Good, clean apartment. Good location by the World Trade Center. Great communication by the host."
4233006,Bay Ridge,"Pros: The place was very nice; good vibes. The host was awesome. He always tried to please every single guest. He always provided information about places to visit and how to get there.
Cons: The only thing that worried me was the bathroom, it was dirty.
Other than that it was a great experience. 
Thank you for everything."
3666653,Bay Ridge,Robert and John are real super hosts. We loved our stay here! I used Airbnb a few times during my trip but this experience was different. A lovely restored old house in a gorgeous neighbourhood. I can recommend this place to everyone who wants to explore the city and live in beautiful area. IT IS AMAZING!!! It was my parents first Airbnb experience. They had a blast! You can't go wrong with this listing. Thanks again for everything John & Robert! You were great hosts!
11020169,Baychester,"Charles was a great host! The apartment was beautiful. Bathroom was the best part, tub was insanely huge! Lovely stay, I would totally stay here again in the future. "
8642982,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Wonderful and hospitable. The place is just as beautiful as the photos. Great experience! 
6842636,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Great place in Brooklyn, close to the subway. Dwight is very communicative and helps fast with everything you could need there."
426475,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"This was a great place if you're on a budget. I needed a place last-minute and the owner Ivo responded very promptly, which helped me out a lot. The only downside is that this place is kind of on the edge of town and the neighborhood isn't necessarily the friendliest. It's a good thing the subway is really close to this place. All in all, a solid experience."
433611,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"100% recomendable, era lo que buscábamos, un lugar donde descansar y bañarnos, y fundamentalmente que sea limpio y cálido para la época en la que fuimos. La cocina estaba muy buena pero no hicimos uso de ella porque estábamos siempre afuera. Y la ubicación estaba muy bien también, enseguida estás en Manhattan. "
4694228,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Perfect host! Everything you need, plus a friendly household in Brooklyn, 2 blocks from the G to Williamsburg and a 10 min walk to a main stop for trains in to Manhattan.
Many thanks Josh!"
1467106,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"We had an amazing stay at Diavanna and Caleb's place. They went above and beyond to make sure we were okay and that we had everything we need. The hosts had a wealth of knowledge and plenty of recommendations to eat, see and do. They were doing some renovations and it was delayed but instead of cancelling our booking they stayed in the apartment and let us stay in their home. We were so appreciative as around new years it would have been a nightmare to find something else. Their home was amazing - the absolute new york experience. Highly recommend this listing and these super hosts! Thanks heaps Dia & Caleb!"
508583,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"We had a great time at Nicole's place.This is a pretty (URL HIDDEN) exactly like on the pictures.Comfortable and clean.The subway is just a few minutes away.Nicole is very helpful and friendly.Than you, Nicole."
4188351,Bedford-Stuyvesant,This place was great for me and my friend. Everything was clean and it had everything we needed. Thank you!
7709799,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"This was perfect for us! Safe neighborhood, lovely AND clean townhouse. Pleasant accommodations with easy access. We effortlessly came and went as we pleased. The metro was a ten min brisk walk (it was chilly anyway) and the bus got us even closer - within a block or two. Lauren quickly responded to any questions we had. "
6659102,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Great place!
8761111,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"As mentioned by fellow Airbnb's travellers here, Terrence is awesome, and his place too of course. He greeted us when we arrived, showed us around and even suggested few places to visit around town. Metro station is just a stone's throw away. Plus, there's a shop with lower prices on your way to the Metro station. We even enjoyed tasty and wholesome breakfast at the Australian cafe nearby. Laundromat, mini market, cafe, etc they're all nearby. And we really like the place, it's like a home away from home. The place comes with plenty of clean towels and toiletries. TV was great too! And Terrance even accomodate to our requests. Great hostmanship!! Keep it up!"
7418759,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Our experience with Beverly was wonderful! Plenty of room for myself and a 7-piece touring band to stretch out and get comfy after a 16 hour drive from Nashville. Despite our late arrival, Bev met us to show us around and even offered to bring by orange juice and breakfast in the morning. She and her partner even let us park our van in the gated lot on their property, which was a HUGE convenience and saved us a lot of time and worry. Lots of friendly characters out and about in the neighborhood (even late at night), but it felt pretty safe overall. The ONLY slight issue we had was that the Wifi wasn't working when we first arrived...but by the time we woke up the next morning, it was up and running again. 

Would recommend Bev's place to friends and will hope to stay here again on our next visit to NYC. Thanks, Bev!"
14670685,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Lalla is awesome! Her place was very cozy and clean. I loved my stay and Lalla was so sweet and welcoming the whole time. There is plenty of storage space for whatever you have with you. I would definitely recommend Lalla's place 
8118112,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"This is a good apartment well situated near subway, stores, coffee bars and restaurants. Like at home in a colorful neighborhood. But quiet and with a small garden with squirrels sometimes. Gregory welcomed us and got us the extra blankets we asked for. He also was so kind as to make the guests in the apartment above us to be more conscious of their movements. We had a very good time and I wouldn't hesitate to go here again."
592785,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Stephanie's place was super clean and comfortable, and also convenient - just a quick subway ride to the other neighborhoods and into Manhattan!  Also she was quick to respond before hosting us; would highly recommend!"
5371463,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Creo que lo más valioso es el anfitrión que siempre está al pendiente de todo lo que suceda, aun cuando en esta ocasión le tocó estar de vacaciones a Johnny siempre estuvo vía telefónica al pendiente de lo que sucediera , quiero aclarar que el departamento no es lo que esperaba , la verdad me esperaba algo más agradable ya que el departamento es viejo , sinceramente en las fotos se ve mucho mejor, al llegar nos desilusionamos mucho pero con el tiempo lo fuimos aceptando ya que debo reconocer que todo está muy limpio y el departamento tiene todo lo necesario para pasarla bien , no es de lujo eso es necesario aclararlo pero si lo que buscan es un lugar para dormir y el resto del tiempo conocer la ciudad , entonces es un buen lugar , aunque está lejos de New York a 30 minutos en promedio"
7480853,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"We arrived earlier than expected and Michelle welcomed us! 
The room is exactly as described and this is a nice neighborhood. 
 We felt like home.
We really had a great time in NYC! 
Thank you very much Michelle!
"
5636395,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"It was my first time traveling to NYC and I had such a great time. Nanie was a great host! Who had a lot of suggestions for places to eat in the area. The room was cozy and the area was definitely quiet so you'll get a good nights rest. This location is close to the transit so getting to Manhattan or wherever else on your destination list is easily accessible. 

Thanks Nanie! "
673248,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nous sommes arrivés avec du retard à cause de notre avion et Claire nous a attendu pour nous accueillir jusqu'à bien plus tard que prévu. L'appartement est impeccable, très fonctionnel avec frigo, micro-ondes, four,… Et la connexion Wifi parfaite ! Le quartier est très agréable, nous rentrions parfois tard le soir sans aucun problème (nous avons même eu la surprise un soir de tomber sur une messe gospel à laquelle nous avons été chaleureusement invités!). Le métro est à 5-10min à pied, il faut prendre la ligne A ou C pour aller jusqu'à Manhattan (ce sont les lignes principales en plus). Il faut compter 15-20min de métro pour y aller, parfois moins, c'est très rapide ! 
Claire est une hôte parfaite, très présente si on a des questions, elle nous a même appeler le taxi pour notre départ pour l'aéroport. Bref séjour exceptionnel, vraiment tristes d'être de retour en France ! Si un jour nous revenons à New York, nous referons appel à elle c'est sur !"
1042416,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Great place, and good size for me and my two friends:) The bedrooms are big and the walk-in-closet between them made kt easy to store our baggage! "
159749,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"I staid at JT and Tippy Lewis last week of June (URL HIDDEN) was my seventh time in NYC , and i had always been in nice places , Manhattan or Brooklyn , but undeniably , JT and Tippy place was the best of the best ...
This is a beautiful house , decorated with nice taste..there are books , carpets , paintings and beautiful things (URL HIDDEN) bedroom was amazingly romantic..I was allowed to stay in the living room , but my bedroom was so nice and big that i spent there all my free time at home
I used also a very convenient kitchen , with everything you need to cook ...From its window , i used to looking at the beautiful garden with birds and squirrels while i was preparing my breakfast....
The subway station is at the corner of the bloc , and the train put you in downtown Manhattan  in about 15 mn..., some night i came back at home that way at 4 in the morning without any problem...
The neighbourhood amazing , with old trees and beautiful houses , but also many shops opened day and night...very nice to come back here  after an exhausting day in Manhattan ..
There are also many interesting places in Brooklyn , museums , bars and shops..
Tippy and JT are the perfect hosts...If you dont need them , you cannot see them and you can believe that all the house is yours..but as soon as you need them , they are there, friendly and helpful ..They are amazing people.
Usually i like to change and i rarely come back in the same place when i travel , but i want to come back in this house when i go back to NYC , and I hope it will have still a room for me ..."
989488,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Mimi, was a great host. Upon arrival she left text me to know to get the key from the doorman because she was not at home, in addition left a note with the key as well. Each morning I woke up to warm biscuits and coffee which was great to start the day.  She gave a good bar to check out which is literally around the corner a half a block.  The listing was accurate room a little small but had AMAZING lighting and the bathroom  was perfect.  All in all, the listing was great and it lived up to my expectations.  "
1645667,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Great BK location, central to so many places! Parking was relatively easy! Ravenna and his brother were easy to work with and very hospitable."
466457,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Hemos estado una semana y lo hemos pasado genial.  El barrio es perfecto, cerca de la casa hay buenos sitios donde comer, cenar o tomar una copa, y por supuesto también tienes supermercados, lavanderías y todos los servicios que puedas necesitar.  El metro a 10 minutos y autobuses urbanos en la calle de al lado.  La casa está genial, es un apartamento totalmente equipado, ideal para dos personas, luminoso, acogedor y limpio.  Y Nicole es la anfitriona ideal, sabes que siempre puedes contar con ella si necesitas algo. En fin, es una pena que las vacaciones duren tan poco!"
3877315,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Basecamp was exactly as described and Alex and Maura perfect hosts, great communication but didn't intrude. I spent four days commuting into Manhattan without a problem. 

Will certainly consider returning on my next trip to NYC."
94477,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"We came from Hawaii on the 7am flight. Vernon responded quickly to any and all questions and even let us check in early! There was parking right in front, which was very convenient. Everything we needed was in the house. Plenty of New York guide books. The couch in the living room folded out to a bed which was helpful for our 3rd guest. We had plenty of towels, dishes, etc. The subway was a 5 min walk to J train. Vernon was easily accessible and really nice. It looks just like the photos online. We would stay there again for sure."
10307958,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Sarah's place was perfect for our family trip to New York. The apartment itself was huge and bright and included a bedroom as well as an office that functioned perfectly as a room for our baby. Sarah herself was very available and responsive. The neighborhood was fantastic too with lots of great restaurants and a short walk to the subway. We had a great trip staying at Sarah's place. 
10310874,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nice place, clean, comfy, and quiet! Ozzy was there to meet us and was very quick to respond via text when we had any questions.  A great spot, would definitely stay again! "
1347847,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Wir sind von Lise's Mutter aufs Herzlichste empfangen und im ganzen für uns zugänglichen Bereich herumgeführt worden. Die Unterkunft ist liebevoll eingerichtet und grosszügig bemessen. Ruhig gelegen und doch mit Subway und Bus leicht erreichbar. Lise und Juan sind herrlich unkompliziert, vertrauensvoll und hilfsbereit. Auch ihre herzigen Kätzchen haben uns gut unterhalten! Wir würden diese Unterkunft, jederzeit wieder buchen, danke Lise und Juan!"
12018241,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nous recommendons vivement l'appartement de Cherly, il est propre et spacieux. De plus, il est situé à 2 pas du métro, ce qui est vraiment pratique.
Nous n'avons pas rencontré Cherly personnellement à cause de notre emploi du temps de visite chargé, mais elle était très sympathique par message, se souciant toujours de nous.
Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine à NYC ! "
5989289,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"I would absolutely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting NYC!! 
We did not  meet Anthony in person, but he was a very attentive host. He gave his cell number , and assigned his nice friend to meet us.  She helped us with everything. 
The apartment was very clean and cozy. Transportation is so easy
; 1 block to G Train, 4 blocks to J Train (which we used to go to the airport). The entire check in/check out process worked seamlessly. 
Characteristic neighborhood with lots of nice restaurants and cafes.. 
Highly recommend it!! "

232612,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Really nice apartment and lovely host! Loved staying there!
9271742,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Perfect experience. The place is exactly as on the pictures and Ben could not be anymore helpful. He provides you with everything you need, is always and super friendly. We would def. go back."
4439839,Bedford-Stuyvesant,We had a great time staying at Ettrick's.  It felt like home every time we returned.  Plenty of space and kitchen amenities.  The natural light is beautiful during the day and neighborhood is relatively quiet at night.  There is a laundromat downstairs so the air smells very fresh and clean.  We never had trouble parking the car on the street.  Very comfortable place with easy communication and transaction.  I would visit again.

4957358,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Amy'loft is very nice!The kitchen  is woderful!The location is very convenience. It's a good experience for us. I love it very much!
638218,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Getting into the air bnb was very easy. There are 2 doors with codes that allow access into the apartment complex and then into the actual studio. Overall I was really disappointed in the cleanliness of this studio. Upon waking in, we noticed the floors felt very dirty. Our socks turned black after walking around. Also the carpet in front of the bathroom was dirty and had black footprints on it. The bed also didn't feel clean. One of the pillows looked like it had someone else's eyeliner on it. The bed was also very uncomfortable and old. The toilet seat was half coming off and would slide around when you sit on it. Other than those issues, I think it's in a great location. It's a 1 minute walking distance from the C train subway which takes you right to manhattan. Also there was a heater which was already turned on for us for our arrival. The tv is also very big! Also forgot to mention the wifi was very weak and didn't work most of the time. "
5029952,Bedford-Stuyvesant,Tiziana was a great host...very accommodating and quick to respond.  Her home is very lovely and quintessential Brooklyn (brownstone).  I highly recommend this place and wish I could've stayed longer!

2471815,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Die Unterkunft war sehr nett gelegen mit Cafes und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Umgebung sowie einer guten Verkehrsanbindung. Die beiden sehr schönen Zimmer bieten viel Platz und sind gemütlich, so dass man sich auch gut dort aufhalten kann. Omar war sehr hilfsbereit, und hat uns sehr gut mit Informationen zur Unterkunft und Tipps zur Umgebung versorgt. 
Insgesamt haben wir die nette Atmosphäre sehr genossen."

5602200,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nice place and affordable! My friend and I are happy with our stay! The apartment had Japanese books and manga, which was pretty cool to see. The bed was so cozy to sleep in with a feather blanket and feather pillows. I was glad that Ippei walked us though the apartment the day we arrived so we would know what to expect. My favorite part of the apartment was the toilet--it was one of those toilets that can heat the seat and has multiple settings to clean up! As for the neighborhood, it was a little scary to walk through around midnight if you're alone, but during the day it was pretty lively and really made you feel like you were having a Brooklyn experience. The train ride is a little long, but we only really noticed it at night when we were tired and ready to chill at the apartment. Overall, I would recommend staying here!"
7596004,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Candice was flexible on check in/check out times, gave us needed information about the unit, and checked back just enough during our stay.  The apartment is stylish and pristine with an A+ kitchen stocked for all needs.  Add the outdoor space, washer & dryer, and air conditioning and you have the place for any length stay.  
Although we had our vehicle with us this visit, the neighborhood is easily walked.  Subway stops, local restaurants, etc. make it possible to connect to other areas or stay and enjoy many local offerings.
We did a lot of ""shopping"" before finding this apartment that exceeded our checklist.  This hostess knows what it takes to provide a warm, relaxing, and functioning environment. 
Thanks, Candice.

970302,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Staying 10 days at Lia and Noah´s place was a pleasure. The apartement was brand new and handy for cooking and cosy to sleep. Beds are amazing! The street is quiet. Even late at night we feel safe going home. Utica station is only 10 min walking distance but there is also à bus going there if you are in a hurry. So basically you are at 20 min from lower Manhattan. Lia and Noah are great hosts. They    make you feel at home, they live right upster easy if you need something ! They recommended us good restaurant in the neighbourhood. We ll definitly recomend the place if you want to live a brownstones expérience in Brooklyn!"
106647,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"I loved this apartment so much I am trying to buy one in the development. Incredible high ceilings, lovely tree lined street, great little cafe/restaurant on the corner. Olivia has impeccable taste and even asked what my favorite teas were and left me pasta to make. Top experience. Every place I have rated highly seems to get snapped up so I hope when I need to come back I can ;-) "
2154567,Bedford-Stuyvesant,I really loved Sharon and Ronn's suite! I wish I offered to stay for a few more days. Now I know where to go for a mini getaway. 
8322478,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Let me begin by saying this place is nothing less than magnificent!! My sister and I traveled to NYC for what was my second and her first time visit.
Upon our late night arrival (flexible with check in, she's awesome!) Mia was kind enough to not just give us the code to let ourselves in but met us downstairs. She warmly welcomed us and showed us around the beautiful apartment.  One look inside this place and you won't want to leave. Beautifully decorated/furnished and incredibly clean. Just immaculate. She informed us with great suggestions to local stores and restaurants we later tried out. So glad we did. I was also pleasantly surprised to see how well stocked the kitchen was with utensils, we took advantage of this and hit the grocery store. She also provides many things that are easily forgotten on any trip, from dry shampoo to contacts lens case, she had it! Be sure to take advantage of the bubbles and draw yourself a bath in the gorgeous claw bath tub after a long day of long subway rides. Music or book buff? Take a look at the amazing selections of books and records you'd needs months (maybe even years) to get through. The beds, OMG. the beds are heaven on earth. For the first time in my life I was saddened at the thought to go back to my own familiar bed. As far as transportation goes the train you'll need to get into Manhattan was a convenient 7 minute walk, grab yourself a snack or drink at the corner bodega thats just a few steps from the front door before your train. She made sure to check in on us via message now and then to make sure we were doing okay, she was always available and always very helpful. Once our departure day arrived we asked if there was any chance we could leave our bags behind for a while we hit the city one last time before our journey back home, she kindly accepted our request. This family is simply amazing, we extend our utmost gratitude for everything provided. I hope we get the opportunity to stay with you again and highly recommend to anyone looking for the best. "
187566,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Very nice little apartment, it was perfect for our family. Comfortable, tastefully furnished, clean, and at walking distance from the subway (two blocks from the G line). Despite the rather shabby apparence, the neighbourghood is quite ok (although friends recommended we took a cab at night, we saw nor experienced nothing disagreeable). I would certainly recommend the apartment and their tenants, Markus and Andrew are most welcoming and the apartment really fine. "
7927838,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Overall our experience was great! Jason was very gracious and welcoming. The check-in and out process was smooth and quick. Our host provided us with listings of popular restaurants, markets and shops which came in very handy. Jason also checked in with us during our stay to see how things were going and if we required any assistance; really nice of him.

He has such a beautiful home! The room has beautiful wood accents, was very neat and spacious, definitely met our needs for the weekend. The rest of the apartment was cozy and neat. We were out during the day/night and did not spend much time in the living room or kitchen (stocked).  The brownstone is a short walk (1-2 minutes) from the A/C line which was an added bonus!

We would recommend without any hesitation! Looking to book in the future!"
7709435,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"The pricing is fair. Everything was as expected and promised. I had a private room and everything I needed for my stay. Digna very responsive and nice in our texts back and forth. I got in late so we didn't meet this time. Perhaps next time we'll meet. I'm sure I'll stay here again if I need to in NYC on a future trip. The transit in the area is easy to get to and there are buses right to the airport that drive by. I felt safe in the neighborhood as well. I appreciate Digna ensuring that everything was looked after for me including all the clean sheets, towels, etc. Great host! :)"
8843995,Bedford-Stuyvesant,We had a great stay here during our trip to NY. Brooklyn is quite a perfect place - it's very easy to get to/from Manhattan and Brooklyn itself is also a nice place to spend time. The appartment was nice and cosy (just like the photos) and Jake and Catherine are great hosts. We tried out some of their recommendations (restaurants and bar) and all in all we were very satisfied with our stay here - and hopefully will be back sometime.

Apesar de não termos encontrado os anfitriões pessoalmente, que estavam viajando, estiveram acessíveis por e-mail e deixaram contatos dos vizinhos para alguma emergência. "

Nice house sll in all"
3131756,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Well organised. Fast/easy service with Mr Moody.
Nice neighborhood, direct on the subway station.

Easy to park in the streets."
1881556,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nous avons voyagé avec nos deux enfants (6 et 14 ans). L'appartement est très spacieux, TRES propre, les lits très grands et vraiment confortables. En plus, les serviettes de toilettes sont changées tous les 4 jours ce qui est vraiment appréciable!! La cuisine est très fonctionnelle (6 feux à gaz pour la cuisinière, four et micro onde...) Kenneth et Ayana nous ont accueillis le jour J avec beaucoup de sympathie. Ils sont restés très disponibles et attentifs tout au long du séjour. Le quartier est très calme (c'est une chance!!) et très proche des deux lignes qui dessert Brooklyn, Manhattan , JFK airport  (ligne A et C), express et local, à 10 minutes de pieds de l'appartement.
Nous sommes très heureux de notre séjour (15 jours). Merci à vous Ayana et Kenneth, vous avez permis de nous sentir comme à la maison!!! :-) See you soon New York!!"

5870127,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"We had a wonderful stay in Brooklyn and were fortunate to have found this home!

298782,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Edward was great to deal with. He accommodated my last-minute need for a room on very short notice. The place was clean and as-described. Great deal. If I need a room in Brooklyn again, I'll look for his listing. "
5210723,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Contact facile avec Matt, bien que pas présent physiquement, il l'était toujours au bout du téléphone. La chambre est simple, c'était suffisant pour mon séjour d'une nuit. L'appartement avait l'air cosy même si je n'y ai pas passé beaucoup de temps. J'ai apprécié pouvoir passer avant l'heure du check in et récupérer mon sac plus tard le jour de mon départ. La ligne de train la plus proche est idéale pour aller dans manhattan rapidement. Pour conclure, lieu idéal pour ne pas payer trop cher, bien dormir et profiter un max de NY !"
227715,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Marylyn is a very nice host. She even gave us two sets of towels because we stayed one week. It is real close to the subway and this subway takes you via express in 15 minutes to downtown Manhattan.
The sharing bathroom was always nice and clean.
A taxi from the La Guardia Airport was 35 $.
It is a carribean neighborhood.

488327,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Nos hospedamos con mi novia durante el mes de Octubre en el departamento de Noemie. La decripcion es tal cual a la del aviso; equipado, amplio, luminoso y comodo. Bien ubicado (1 cuadra de la linea G) y 5 de la (A). Ideal para conocer Brooklyn por dentro, alejado del bullicio de Manhattan. Todo esto sumado a la excelente predisposicion de Noemie para todo. Quizas le faltaria una mejor señal de internet y una tv con cable. En conclusion: super recomendable!!!

Andre is a great host! Very welcoming and outgoing. "

Thanks again for everything Renee."

Nous avons passé un agréable séjour. L'appartement est charmant et fonctionnel pour 4 personnes. Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Darrnell et Allison (car ils présentaient leur bébé à leur famille en Australie), cependant, la soeur de Darnelland nous a accueilli de manière chaleureuse.
Le logement est bien situé, à proximité d'une station de métro bien desservie (20 minutes de Manhattan).
Le quartier est tranquille, les gens sont incroyablement aimable et serviables.
Très bonne adresse."

865033,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Tee nous a accueillies très gentiment et nous a fait visiter l'appartement. Il était possible de la contacter en cas de besoin car elle habite dans le même immeuble.
L'appartement est à 5 min à pied du métro J (facile d'accès à partir de l'aéroport) et à 20min de chinatown.
Il y a de petites supérettes autour. Le quartier , qui est populaire, était tranquille ce qui nous a permis de très bien dormir la nuit. Par ailleurs, la literie était de bonne qualité. Les chambres sont pourvues de climatiseurs (un peu bruyants) indispensables en cas de grosse chaleur. Il y avait le nécessaire dans la cuisine (sel, poivre, huile, sucre, différents cafés, thés...) et tous les ustensiles pour éventuellement cuisiner. Nous étions 4 filles et nous nous sommes senties en sécurité, nous étions vigilantes comme à Paris.
Je recommande ce logement qui a un très bon rapport qualité/prix."

197942,Bedford-Stuyvesant,We had the right amount of email exchange before our arrival and there was lots of information about food stores and good places to eat and find coffee in the apartment.  Toni introduced herself and left us pretty much to ourselves.  As I didn't have a phone she kindly organised a car service to collect us and take us to Manhattan for our last day.  My daughter and I bought the 7 day metro ticket and we used it on the metro and the buses.  Location was great for access to different metro lines and bus routes. Quite a funky neighbourhood.

Communication with Norga was a breeze up to and throughout our stay. They even threw us a block party when we arrived! Ha.. But the real treasure is the neighborhood. I grew up in Queens but have been out of NY for years. I'm familiar with the Brooklyn renaissance but hadn't seen it for myself. It really is amazing. We stayed for four days and never even went into Manhattan. Every direction of travel leads you to equally unique, multicultural, diverse and eclectic neighborhoods in BK. With Bed Stuy at the center of it all. Highly recommend!!"

The kitchen and bathrooms are well stocked, Shower is hot everyday. Folasade is an great cook too and always answers any questions or concerns that I may have. Definitely worth the extra money to stay in a neat place. Newly renovated. Design of the apartment is better than the pics. Cozy space. Most importantly, no bugs. Steven is a nice guy, very straightfoward. No problems being here at all. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.

Having said that I would feel slightly wary of walking around after dark if I was on my own. The brownstone was very comfortable and spacious however the bathroom is quite small. A lovely added touch was the wine, eggs, juice and milk which Brian left as a welcoming gift. "

7111050,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"Amber was very proactive and gave specific instructions before my arrival regarding check-in. The living room is kept clean and in order. The location is great as it's walking distance from the metro, and takes only about 30-45 minutes to Manhattan.  The futon was pretty comfortable as far as futons go. I really enjoyed my stay here, and would book it again if I come back to visit NY! 

I would recommend bringing earplugs and eye covers in general when you travel anywhere; there was a night where the neighbors were a little loud next door."

The apartment itself was big and spacious and equipped with everything we needed - it felt like our little home away from home.
Dana was a very welcoming host, helping us with our luggage up the stairs and giving us tips and recommendations about her neighbourhood. Originally we were only planning to stay 5 nights but thankfully we were able to stay an extra night, as Dana was so gracious in allowing us to change our plans at the last minute.
Next time we head to Brooklyn we would definitely stay at Dana's again. "

921585,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"It is a beautiful appartment with plenty of space, light and comfort. I enjoyed getting to know Brooklyn but the commute to work in midtown Manhattan took quite some time (45/50 minutes). The neighbourhood is mainly residential and some distance from the more lively areas further north and west. Adina and her team were welcoming."

Thank you for delightful stay, Mark."
694016,Boerum Hill,"With 141 reviews already in the bank, what can I add that will matter to you?  Not much.

Everything everyone else said about convenient connections to the city and the neighborhood and the room are all true.

Silvano and Craig have this Airbnb hosting down to both a science and an art.  You can't go wrong here.

My one unique comment is that chatting with them motivated me to go read the Ferante novels in the original Italian."
1692360,Boerum Hill,"My wife and I participated in a family event in Brooklyn earlier this month and we wanted to just stress the pleasure we experienced in staying at this location. Everything was exactly as described in the ad. The duplex location was great, a couple of blocks from major commercial streets, lined with quaint stores and restaurants. It is also located at walking distance from a subway hub on Atlantic avenue, that connects you to Manhattan/Coney Island or many other places). 
The house itself can easily accommodate 6 people (provided that you share one of the 2 bathrooms for the people staying in the separate studio). It is overall pretty quiet and private, particularly at night since the two main bedrooms are upstairs and a bit away from the street noise). The outside patio would certainly be a great spot for a beer or an afternoon tea (even though we were too busy to really enjoy it).
The house is fully furnished and supplied with all expected goodies and amenities: linens and blankets, pillows, towels, plates and dishes, etc... In addition, you may even benefit from some food items left over from previous tenants... You may enjoy the local internet connection along with  a couple of big screens TVs and Bose music system as well. Finally, there is a spacious basement where you can find washer, dryer, iron and ironing board, etc...  
Robert is a kind and affable host, very attentive to his guests needs. He'll provide you with maps and advice on the neighborhood resources. Overall, you really have the impression of enjoying your own"" home away from home"" instead of a tight impersonal hotel room... I would highly recommend this place or stay there again if needed in the future."
506306,Boerum Hill,"Lovely place to stay, as in the pictures. A great host too! Would definitely stay again."
1717499,Boerum Hill,"Being between apartments, one lease ending two weeks before the next one started, I decided to use this opportunity to take a vacation in my own city. Mina's quaint studio apartment in Boerum Hill fit the bill: a neighborhood I hardly knew and could explore, but would allow me to get to work without any added time to my usual commute. This apartment is quiet, charming, and close to everything! Smith Street is full of fun and interesting shops and restaurants, and there are at least 7 subway lines that are less than a mile away. Although small, the studio's space is well-utilized and very comfortable. The windows open on a cool, bright garden view. I had a lovely stay!"

513362,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"I Had a Long term stay here. Deb Happened to be around Penn Station when I arrived and kindly met me and we went back to the house together. It is as it states a small room in a large house - The House was under some renovation when I arrived but it has been greatly improved in 2 months and it is very comfortable neighborhood - I never had any issues re Safety/. The Garden is an added bonus, The room is small so in the summer months it does get very hot though there is a fan - for Autumn winter this should be ideal as the room will be warmer than other parts of the house. It does face the street so if you are a light sleeper you should bring earplugs or whatever you need as you do get the neighborhood noise but it is a city so... Also the subways are close but as with all public transportation it is hit or miss you can take 25 minutes to get into NYC or an (URL HIDDEN) plan accordingly ... There are a couple of tenants living there but they are very respectful. Deb is very accommodating and straight forward I must add this because I think there are a couple negative reviews that these came from guests that did not abide by the house rules and brought people in that were not pre approved or paid for . People should remember that this is someone's house specifically here it's not even a hostel like situation or an hotel and therefore you should not treat the host's property as such assuming you have the right to do whatsoever. So really as long as you talk with your host before hand and arrange things you should have a wonderful stay.  Deb knows a lot about New York if you have the opportunity to catch her in one evening. All in all it was a very pleasant experience."
8106619,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"This was the first time I experienced using Airbnb, and I definitely would recommend it.  Thomas answered all my questions and the apartment was just the way it looked in the pictures.  The apartment was clean and very homey.  Spent the weekend visiting family and was able to bring my grandson to the Prospect Park Zoo, which was awesome.  Prospect Park was so close, great for walking.  Had a wonderful experience, sad part it ended too soon."
9806373,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Wonderful to come back to after a hectic day in New York with lovely comfy beds. Slept like a log. 
 Grace is a great host and nothing is too much trouble for her. A lovely lady. We were greeted with pizza and cans of pop and had a lovely chat with Grace. 
The apartment is a short walk from the 5 and 2 lines and around 30-40 mins into Times Sq. 
If we return to NY we will definitely stay with Grace. Many thank's."
10042595,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"This is a grat place to stay for a lagrer group.We were 7 and we all(2+2+2+1) had separate rooms, 2 bathrooms and a big living room with kitchen(on 3 floors). The house is all just for you. If you are interested in a place where you can make some meals, sit with friends to discus some plans or drink a glass of wine after a tyring day - just take it. The place is not very modern, but ok - you should not be dissapoinded, especially for this price. The owners are very friendly and try to help as much as they can. What else... some convinient grocery stores are 2 bloks away, subway too. Please have oin mind that the trip to Manhatan will take a bit less than an hour and during weekends some lines are not avaiable, but you can always help yourself by taking a bus along Nostrand Ave to reach more lines."
240918,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Benjamin was a really nice host and communication was great. 
Even though what he says in the profile about the neighbourhood is true, we never felt unsafe and people were very nice. It has loads of places to eat at a very reasonable price, and it only takes about 30 minutes to get to Manhattan.
I would definitely want to stay here again if I ever visit New York again."
2197673,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"I used Wade's apartment to host my bday dinner and my guests and I had an amazing time. Wade was such a great host. My hubby and I had great conversation with him before he let us have the place to ourselves. He is such a down to earth person. It was so great meeting him. The pictures he provided lets you know what you are getting, but seeing it in person is on another level. My guests and I were so amazed by the amount of space the 1 bedroom apartment was. The talk of the night was the decor, such amazing taste. All night they complimented him on how beautiful the apartment was down the scent. I really can't find one bad thing to say about the place. We would definitely stay again! "
368081,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,We showed up withour giving a time and it was no problem at all bens room mate Antonio was on point with the keys. Both of them were very accommodating and on top of keeping this place looking great. A definite recommend for anyone looking for an affordable spot with people you can rely that want clean and quiet... I could see coming back to this one. 
2041283,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"We had an excellent stay with Marcela. The apartment, bathroom, and bedroom were super clean and organized, and the bedroom had plenty of space. Marcela was excellent, she helped us figure out how to get to the building when we first arrived, gave us the tour and even left a note on the fridge with helpful instructions for laundry, wifi password, and even nearby places to eat and get groceries (including vegetarian options). She made it clear that we were welcome to use anything in the kitchen, showed us our room, and left us to our own devices. There's even a lot of original artwork hanging on the walls, which we loved. There were towels and washcloths in our room, along with a bottle of water and two glasses, a hair dryer, a travel wall charging brick with two USB ports, earplugs (the train runs right by the apartment, but it didn't bother us), and a comfy bed.  If you're a pillow hog like me, though, you might want to bring an extra pillow. We had two and I'm spoiled - I'm used to two pillows for myself. The bathroom was clean and the shower had instant hot water and great water pressure. We actually didn't see Marcela again for the rest of our trip (five nights) though she did check in with us over text to make sure we were doing alright and didn't need anything. The apartment is only a couple of blocks right off the Q train, and it was super easy for us to get anywhere we wanted to go. Plus, there is a 24-hour manned parking garage adjacent to the building, where we were able to park our car for $22 a day - which was fantastic, because we drove up. We found it on parkWhiz and it was the best rate we could find, since we didn't want to try to find street parking. All in all, we had a great trip, and this was the perfect place for us to stay. I HIGHLY recommend staying here. I can't tell you enough how much we appreciated everything about staying here. It really made our trip that much better. "
846018,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"The little apartment was lovely. Really spacious and the area was great - located near Prospect Park and the B, Q & S subway station. (about 20-30min subway ride to Manhattan) Theres also small restaurants, bars, and markets near by if you ever just want to grab a quick bite or drinks. Would definitely recommend this place for a stay if you're ever wanting to visit! :) "
240329,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Unfortunately I never had the chance to meet Benjamin as he was away for work during my stay. However, his Partner, Landy, was there to greet us as we arrived, and show us around. The other house guests were very friendly, and the whole place was very well organised. If you're considering staying in the Flatbush/Prospect Park area, I would recommend Ben's place."
7763869,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,The house locates in a good place that not far from the subway station. It is only 10 minuntes walk and 20 minutes to the center of NY city. The room is good and Anita gives us helpful information for the travel in NY. She is very helpful to open the door when we check out at 6 am in the morning. A wonderful place to leave and good place to explore later!
2169106,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Brett was accommodating and easy to communicate with, check-in was easy. Location was easily accessible via subway. "
10490073,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Very pleasant experience. Hajra was very communicative. She and Sam were very flexible regarding the check in time. Sam was friendly, open, and easy-going. The apartment was very clean. The room was quite big (we had 8 bags and room to spare). I'd stay again."
685006,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Matt was an extremely gracious and accommodating host. He was very flexible about arrival and departure times, and made sure to make it convenient for me. Because I was new to NYC and didn't have the hang of the subway system yet, I was an hour late to meet him on my arrival, and he didn't even bat an eye. He also gave me the option to check out later.

And while my strict diet didn't allow me to take advantage, Matt generously offered the various foodstuffs and beer that were in the apartment.

I didn't realize that the apartment was so close to the Prospect Park subway station: this had its advantages and disadvantages. It was certainly convenient to be so close on cold nights when returning from Manhattan, but the sound from the subway was quite noticeable. It didn't end up bothering me too much, but it was a nice touch that Matt provided earplugs by the bed!

The temperature of the apartment was pleasant throughout my stay, and I was very happy to have instant hot water (and I mean really hot!) in the sinks and shower.

The wifi was fast and reliable, which made it easy for me to get work done.

As I do a lot of cooking for myself, I do wish that there had been better/more kitchen equipment, but I made do with what was available.

The bulk of my activities during my stay were in Manhattan, and it so happened that they were not near the lines that go to Prospect Park (B, Q), so given my circumstances, it wasn't ultimately the most convenient location, so I would caution prospective guests to investigate this point for themselves.

Overall, this was a very positive experience, and I'm thankful to Matt for making me feel comfortable and at home!"
4285571,Prospect-Lefferts Gardens,"Denis was a gracious host and was able to accommodate us on very short notice. His apartment was in great shape and fit me and my two kids perfectly! Nice kitchen and bathroom was fine for three people. Although the apartment building is on a busy street, we heard no street traffic. The one drawback is that there is no central A/C; most of the time this wouldn't be a big deal but the week we visited was one of the hottest and the two window units were pretty taxed keeping the apartment cool. They are noisy as well so be prepared for that.
   The neighborhood is nice; lots of small mom and pop stores and restaurants and some good coffee shops as well. Awesome bar is right across the street! Organic grocery store is close by and regular grocery store is a few more minutes away. Three minute walk to the subway and a great park is close by as well.
   All in all, a most enjoyable stay. Would highly recommend a stay with Denis; he texted regularly to inquire how we were doing and if there was anything he could do to make our stay more pleasurable. Have nothing but great things to say about him and the apartment!"
3790118,Mott Haven,Chip was a fantastic host. Very accomadable to my changes of reservation and going in and out. He had his own friends over one night for a dinner party which personally didn't bother me because they weren't being obnoxious. Very nice. Mia the dog might be greatest dog I've ever encountered in my entire life and looks a lot like gizmo the gremlin. 
3431378,Mott Haven,Alexes was very friendly and accommodating. We were 5 college students looking for a nice place to stay at a reasonable price and within reasonable distance to downtown and this location was ideal. The house was also located only 5 minutes from the subway station. Very nice accommodation and I would stay there again. 
630186,Brooklyn Heights,"Location excellent for activities in Brooklyn Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. Host was very congenial and helpful during our stay. Shared tenant arrangement was new to us, but accommodation was comfortable, clean, and convenient."
3457034,Brooklyn Heights,"Shari is a very friendly, obliging person. It is fun talking to her and she knows very good hints and tips. She will take care of the questions you have and will respond to them as good as possible. 
Her place is clean and cosy and her pets might come and ask for some attention. 

Shari's apartment  is a very good spot to explore both - Brooklyn and Downtown Manhatten. Just a view walking minutes away, the Metro System opens you the whole city. If you want to walk over to Manhatten - it can be reached via the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge within just 35 minutes. If you just want to hang out in downtown Brooklyn and explore the bars and nightlife or shopping - all this is just a few blocks to walk. And if you do want to have a scenic hike - feel free to hit the Brooklyn piers down at east river (20 Min walk). They provide beautiful views of the financial district and lower Manhatten. 

All togehter I can highly recommend her place to everybody who wants to explore New York and Brooklyn in a safe and beautiful neighborhood at decent prices. For me it was the perfect place for my first NYC experience. 

"
5315955,Brooklyn Heights,"Michael was a great host.  He responded right away to my texts and emails.  The check in was easy, I met Andrew the super and he provided everything I needed. The listing itself is a classic new York walkup, and is as Michael described on the most famous street in Brooklyn.  Right outside you can find three very famous restaurants including Grimaldi's and the Shake Shack.  And you are steps away from the Brooklyn Bridge Park with spectacular views of the Manhattan skyline.  This location is about as centrally located as it gets.  I would recommend this listing to anyone who wants to be in the middle of the action!"
15358886,Brownsville,Loved the stay. Awesome host ! 
7734173,Brownsville,"Lou has been a very nice host and me and my boyfriend really appreciated the fact that he waited for us until late night after our flights were delayed twice. The location is very close to the subway station (only two blocks away) and the room was comfortable and very clean, as well as the bathroom! We will definitely come back to Lou's apartment in the future."
15042536,Bushwick,Aaron's place is centrally located and very clean. We felt comfortable being there and enjoyed our stay. Thanks for being a great host!
2061725,Bushwick,"Miao was immediately welcoming, so friendly, and made us feel at home. Even when we got in at 1am he was there with a smiling face checking up on us :) We really loved the apartment, our room was small but everything fit together perfectly so we never felt cramped, and having our own bathroom was an added bonus. Bushwick has a bit of an edge to it but we were used to it by the end of our stay and you can walk to many interesting spots in less than half an hour."
8036500,Bushwick,"This was my first bnb and it was a great experience. Of course, we were pretty much out of the house for the majority of the trip exploring. Great amenities as well. Very friendly couple with an amazing location in bushwick. Thanks again for being such a great host!"
4437790,Bushwick,Description was accurate.  Host was available for assistance and easy to work with.  
6391438,Bushwick,"Wayne is a GREAT host.  I felt very welcome in his home.  He allowed me to check in at 7:30am, so cool! This is rare, often because people may have other guests still needing to check out, but still, i'd imagine he would have let me in regardless.  Also there was no uptightness about my check out time either, also something I appreciate.  
It's a very quiet place, and I rented in the winter. I hope to rent again in the summer because that patio is awesome!!
Another great thing about this place is how close it is to the subway.  I often stay out very late during my trips to NYC and I felt totally safe walking that one block each night by myself at 3am.
AND the bed is very comfortable."
11708,Bushwick,cozy space that served as a great little base for my brief time in NYC 
7086539,Bushwick,"Jermaine estuvo muy atento en todo momento, contestando a los correos inmediatamente. El barrio es seguro aunque no lo parezca, nosotros no tuvimos ningún problema. Hay una linea de metro directa al downtown en 20 minutos por lo que la ubicación, teniendo en cuenta el precio es buena. Recomiendo este alojamiento 100%. Gracias Jermaine y gracias Nueva York, nos vemos pronto."
8015001,Bushwick,"Eden is fantastic host accommodated my arrival and departure times. I left the bag after check out time. She responds promptly to texts. The bedroom has a private bathroom (tub) inside. Nice large bedroom, big mirror in the room. The apartment is 2 mins away from M train. Safe neighborhood. Great host! "
4250746,Bushwick,"We really enjoyed staying in Kevin's apartment. It was close to the subway and in walking distance to everything you need. 
For a family it is a great way of staying because of the rooms and the open kitchen. The kitchen is fine to cook easy meals in and the table is nice to hang out around. Kevin helped us with our laundry and gave us a CD with his great music, thank's! The apartment is quite dark inside but it has everything you need. "
55505,Bushwick,"I was really glad to spend the month in the studio, as well described as on airbnb. it was very spacious for two people and well furnished.And i add that i really enjoy the style and deco of the studio,pretty lovely.

Darius was very friendly for our arrival to the studio,explaining clearly everything about the place and some essential stuffs about nyc life.He was always available to ask to any questions!

Even if at first sight,the area seems unsafe, i realized that it is a quiet and safe place to stay. i love Bushwick!!!!!

I really recommend this place to stay,either short or long vacations.A very good and cheap place out of Manhattan,well located for transportation to the airport and the core of new york city with J and M lines. And it also enables to discover another aspect of new york!

thanks!"
83243,Bushwick,"Julian était sur place (il habite au dernier étage) et nous a rapidement mais bien accueilli. Il n'est pas toujours chez lui alors que la wifi est un vrai problème : elle ne fonctionne pas toujours et est très lente. 
L'appartement est en sous-sol. Il n'a qu'une seule petite fenêtre et le voile qui la recouvre aurait besoin qu'on puisse l'attacher dans la journée. Le réfrigérateur est plutôt bruyant et les voisins de l'étage supérieur marche parfois à des heures incongrues, ce qui peut être agaçant. 
Pour le reste l'appartement est correctement équipé. Il manquait cependant une chaise. 
Le quartier n'est pas très entretenu  mais nous avons apprécié la proximité des commerces, et notamment d'un supermarché. Chez les commerçants, nous avons fait la connaissance de plusieurs africains francophones (pratique pour demander des informations précises alors l'accent américain était un peu difficile à comprendre pour nous). La station de métro est vraiment très proche du logement. Il faut cependant se méfier des métros qui ne s'arrêtent pas toujours à la station aux heures d'affluence. 
"
16141887,Bushwick,"Danielle was a wonderful host. Super kind and welcoming. (Upon our arrival, she had a bottle of Moscato for my husband and I to enjoy for his first visit to NYC.) Her home was quaint, quiet (even though you are super close to the above ground subway train - its literally a 3 min walk), and lovely. She has everything you could need to prepare something, although we rarely used the kitchen... there was WAY too much amazing food for me to be cooking, and Danielle also has a list of her fav restaurants and take out food in the area. This came in handy on our late and exhausting arrival to NYC. The place is PERFECT for a couple looking to getaway. The shower/ bathroom is amazing!! And she even offered bathroom necessities, such as soap, bubble bath, etc. Also, if you were to leave anything at home, you are (again) a 3 min walk from a Rite Aid, a beauty supply, and a REALLY good coffee shop (I wish I could remember the name!)

The home IS Danielle's home, but she was kind enough to clear everything away, so that my husband and I could use her storage areas. Literally, the ONLY thing I would make a comment about is the bed. It is definitely a firm mattress. If you own a firm mattress, that will not be a problem, but for me being that we sleep on a pillowtop, it took a bit of adjusting. However, I would DEFINITELY recommend Danielle's place a 100%! I hope she continues to host! Everyone she experience her loveliness and her little Bushwick Retreat. "
11755816,Bushwick,"The apartment was beautiful, big and light - exactly as it looks in the photographs. My husband and I stayed for over a month and thoroughly enjoyed it. It became home."
6782841,Bushwick,"awesome place. laramie's a super nice dude and was very helpful and easy to reach. 5 min walk to/from the halsey st stop, so it was easy to get around the city. highly recommended! "
10723838,Bushwick,"Attila was a great host, kind friendly  very responsive and helpful! Accomodationg to last minute travel changes as well. The space is just as pictured, very cute comfortable and well cleaned daily. he has a VERY cute cat that is well mannered and friendly, as an animal lover that only enhanced my stay :) If this neighborhood frightens you, you should probably not BE in New York lol, a lot of great street art, thrift shops and food in the area (especially OMG pizza which is a short walk away and open late!) I would recommend and stay again!"
4966041,Bushwick,"You need to stay here on your next NYC trip! Michelle and her husband made my girlfriend and I feel at home in their gorgeous Bushwick house. Michelle is so sweet and thoughtful, making sure we didn't need anything. Their place is incredibly clean and nice looking and the fact that we had our own bathroom was marvellous. The bedroom gathered about pretty much anything we could possibly want, going from books to maps and brochures. They are located near the J subway line (which in my opinion is the worst MTA line!) but their home is only a 10 min walk away from the closest station. We also totally fell in love with their cat Harry which was the cutest little thing there could be! Would come back anytime, thank you Michelle and Austin :)"
3583702,Bushwick,"We enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn. The flat was fine for our needs and well located at less than 30 minutes from Union Square, Manhattan. Also, as it's so close to the L line, it's really convenient for going out in Brooklyn, Williamsburg etc. Erin was a good host: he helped us with a couple of things we needed during our stay.The flat could have been a bit cleaner and also could be a bit lighter (as it is a lower-ground/semi-basement flat)."
832096,Bushwick,"Joshua and Franck were very attentive and communicative, and we felt right at home in their studio. The neighborhood is awesome and very convenient for exploring both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's a short walk to the J, M and L trains, and there are many express trains available into Manhattan. Bushwick is also really fantastic to just walk around and explore. We loved all of the street art murals in the area! The apartment appeared just as listed and was perfect for what we needed. The kitchen is much bigger and nicer than one would expect in a NY studio. This apartment is perfect for the traveler who wants to experience what it's like to live as a local. "
767562,Bushwick,"I spent great 3 months at this place. The house is beautiful with very big living room and kitchen. Everyone is kind, welcoming and very friendly. The neighbourhood is nice (easy access to L/M/J lines). 
Kyla is very easy going and ready to help and answer any kind of questions. 
I would totally recommend this place.

1817510,Bushwick,"We had a great time! Charisse was nice, quiet, helpful and kind. "
9233491,Bushwick,"We found Taylor's place none too clean but otherwise just as described. The bedroom facing the street can be somewhat noisy so bring your earplugs if you want it quiet. The connection to Manhattan is fantastic; in 30-40 minutes we went pretty much anywhere. Close to Taylor's there are also some cool places, we particularly liked ""Variety"" on the way to the subway that offers excellent coffee and pastries. We briefly ran into Taylor and her roommate Yoni but had the place to ourselves most of the time. I felt welcome and would definitely stay here again!"
2739793,Bushwick,"I felt very welcome.  Seth kept in contact as my arrival date approached and we did some last minute adjustments of our meeting time, which was helpful.
My son lives nearby, so I was familiar with the neighborhood.  And, had a great time continuing to explore and getting to know Bushwick.  Naturally trips to Manhattan were a breeze.  The week I spent felt major down time.  I was comfortable at Seth's and felt very much at home and at ease while there.  His place is remarkably spacious.  I almost felt bad I hadn't brought a friend or other family members.  Every thing you need is on hand.  One could easily cook all their meals there."
3792910,Bushwick,"Beautiful, artistic apartment in Brooklyn, just few steps from L train to Manhattan, supermarket across the street and many restaurants nearby. The apartment is fully equipped with everything you need. Karen was very helpful, waiting for us on the day of arrival till 1 am, providing us with all necessary information and available at any time. Totally recommended."
3404472,Bushwick,"Excellent séjour à New-York! Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour chez Kip, l'appartement est magnifique, c'est une véritable galerie d'art contemporain. La chambre est spacieuse et confortable. L'appartement est propre et agréable. Il se situe à moins de 5 minutes d'une station de métro ce qui est très agréable pour se rendre en ville.

Kip est génial,très accueillant et très arrangeant pour les hôtes. Il partage ses créations artistiques et coup de cœur musicaux. Ce partage culturel permet pleinement de s’imprégner de la culture New-Yorkaise.

Nous te remercions encore Kip pour ce séjour, et nous regrettons de ne pas avoir pu rester plus longtemps.

See you soon!"

14373756,Bushwick,my parents loved it! Everything was perfect! If you are Brazilian and looking for a place to stay.
3533604,Bushwick,I needed a late booking for Leo And Dallas of Okapi Sun and Rylan was quick to respond and provide details and Info. Great location. Clean and tidy private room Nd a big plus for us was gated parking. Rylan was super friendly and helpful and very knowledgable on the area. Great stay!
1888006,Bushwick,I had a great stay with Erica. Being my first time using Airbnb I loved it and the experience of staying with friends (in an unconventional way) in the city compared to a hotel. Her home was very open and welcoming and had full access to everything including kitchen. I would defiantly come again and continue to use the site!! 
1493265,Bushwick,"Diana is a wonderful host and her apartment is simply beyond good - clean, super stylish and close to public transportation.

5031178,Bushwick,"Unser Aufenthalt in ""The Bushwick House"" war toll! Die Wohnung ist sehr comfortabel und sauber. Alles was man so braucht, ist vorhanden. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr freundlich und sicher. In der Nähe sind 2 Subway- Stationen, die in höchstens 5 Minuten zu Fuss jeweils zu erreichen sind. Mit der Subway ist man in genau 25 Minuten in der Mitte von Manhattan (Union Square). Manhatten ist großartig, aber wir (Eltern mit 14jähriger Tochter) haben es genauso genossen, durch Brookyln zu laufen und auch die ""kleinen Dinge"" zu entdecken.
Shosh and Miles, die wir beide kurz kennengelernt haben, sind sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeber! Die Kommunikation war einfach und schnell. Vielen Dank nochmals!"
4813140,Bushwick,"Der Gastgeber war sehr gut erreichbar, sodass auch im Vorfeld der Reise eine Kommunikation reibungslos möglich war und alle meine Fragen beantwortet wurden. 
Die Unterkunft war für unsere große Gruppe von acht Personen ausreichend. Jeder hatte sein Zimmer. 
Die Dachterrasse ist auf jeden Fall das Herzstück des Apartments. Genügend Sitzgelegenheiten boten uns an den warmen Sommerabenden einen entspannten Abend. 
Die Anbindung zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt war aufgrund der nahegelegenden Metrostation super. 
Wir haben unsere acht Tage Urlaub in New York wirklich genossen."
6257586,Bushwick,"Maybe I misunderstood, but I don't think this listing was very accurate at all.  First of all, the photos of the room are not accurate.  It was more bare, and undecorated in person.   However, I was mostly appalled by the fact that there were other guests staying in the apartment.  There were three bedrooms total, mine, a single bed where a guy was staying, and a third bedroom where I am guessing a couple was staying?  I am saying ""i am guessing"", because I never actually saw the girl who was staying in that room, just the guy.  I could hear her coughing at all hours of the day though, so I am guessing she was sick.  I wasn't too keen on the idea of staying with guys, so I picked a female host for a reason.  I only saw Christina once, briefly.  I was also under the impression that she lived in the apartment, but there was no other room that she would have been staying in. All in all, I feel like I was blindsided, due to a lack of information. This was more of a hostel set up, which I was trying to avoid.  I didn't feel comfortable or safe staying here.  "

14595545,Bushwick,"This was the best place I've stayed in in New York (and the best Airbnb I've stayed in). Such great value for money, the rooms are HUGE and there is such great attention to detail to make sure all your needs are cared for. I didn't meet Steph but there was a really detailed welcome message with all the information needed plus great tips for exploring locally. 

Getting the key was easy - picking up and dropping off at a cafe round the corner, so I didn't need to walk far with my luggage.

It was really well decorated and the bed was super comfy, and they even left toothbrushes and soaps out if you needed them! The kitchen was big enough to cook in which I haven't found so easy in other New York apartments, and there was a massive dining room joining the kitchen and living room (which is as big as you see in the pictures).

I'd definitely stay here again next time I come back to Brooklyn, 100% recommend it

407469,Bushwick,"Just got back from an awesome trip to NYC which was made even more amazing by the wonderful accommodations provided by Majar and his family. My friend and I were out late most nights so we didn't interact with Majar very much but any time we happened to run into any one they were always so friendly and welcoming. Majar even sent us a text when we left to wish us a safe trip! 

The room is exactly as pictured but it's even better in person if that's possible! The bathroom is shared for the entire floor but it is incredibly clean and I think I may have waited once to use the facilities the entire time I was there so don't let that deter you. There is also a kitchen that is available for your use should you like to have a cheap night ( NY is expensive y'all) and they even keep it stocked with coffee and tea for a morning pick me up! 

Also in terms of getting around there is a metro station really close by and like I mentioned before we got back very late most nights but I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. Also if you do wind up getting back late, make sure to be careful closing the screen door as it is very light and I accidentally slammed it once! Sorry!

Honestly if you are hesitating to book this place, don't! All of these glowing reviews are not a fluke, it is an amazing place run by a family that is the epitome of hospitable and caring. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. 10 stars!"
12901480,Bushwick,"Jack's place was great! Perfect location, short train trip into the city with out the craziness of staying in manhattan. The place was big enough for 4 people as described, with shops only a stones throw away in bushwick and williamsburg. Jack was highly accommodating to all our requests and very easy to deal with. Would highly recommend staying here and we will again when we come back to ny!"
12489313,Bushwick,"Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit in New York. Die Kommunikation mit Julio und Gaudi war perfekt, sie waren jederzeit hilfsbereit und sehr freundlich - ein Super Host. Das Apartment ist großzügig und gut ausgestattet, die Anbindung mit der U - Bahn nach Manhattan ideal und Julio's Tips zur Erkundung der näheren Umgebung einfach genial. Wir werden sicher wiederkommen und können diese Unterkunft mit seinen Gastgebern nur empfehlen - vielen Dank für alles !!!"
396349,Bushwick,"We are very grateful to Melissa for making us feel so welcome during our stay. The flat is absolutely lovely, and we were very comfortable there. I highly recommend staying with Melissa if you're in New York! "
15743151,Bushwick,"A really cool and comfortable place in the Brooklyn area. I had actually no much time to talk to Brett(host) because I was almost go out but he responds quickly every time. The apartment is located near the station, maybe not suitable for those really sensible with noise, but for me it was no problem. The interior is so nice, cool Brooklyn style which I was imagined :) Highly recommend!!"
14547563,Bushwick,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7871818,Bushwick,"Exactly as described, simple basement with all you're basic needs. Tom was very helpful and had great communication. For the price it's great."

2228824,Bushwick,"공항에서 갔을때 j,z(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)에서 내렸는데 10분은 울퉁불퉁한 보도블럭을 큰 캐리어 끌고 겨우 갔어요 도착했을때 계단이 정말 장난아니게 많아 짐이 크거나 무거운 분들에게는 비추천해요 다인실을 썼는데 정말 다인실이였어요 집주인과 공동으로 운영하시는 분 같은데 본인이 1번방 쓰면서 여자친구랑 본인이 앉는다고 쇼파로 매일 바꾸고 배게나 이불은 빤적이 없어보이고 그냥 그위에 시트를 줘서 갈아쓰라하고 먼지 구덩이였어요 오직 시트만 제공한다며 거실에 있던 휴지도 첫날에 있었는데 다음날 치우고 우리가 뭐 하기만 하면 나와서 하나하나 확인하고 잘 정리부탁한다 연락오고 우린 정말 잠만 잤는데... 뭔가 동양인 차별을 느꼈어요. 첫날 우리랑 주인이랑 두팀만 있었는데 밤 12시에 갑자기 방에서 나오더니 부엌에서 파인애플을 믹서기로 가는데...매너가 없는건지 생각이 없는건지 분명 숙소 룰에 11시 이후에는 잠을 잘수있게 조용하라는데 믹서를... 동네가 흑인동네고 역은 공장들 있는쪽이라 여자 둘이서 다니기 위험할꺼같고 해서 7-8시쯤 들어갔는데 본인 친구들불러서 우리 쇼파베드에서 술마시고 노래틀고 놀고있고 우리가 가면 비켜주던지 움직이지도 않고 십분간 서성이니까 친구들이 겨우 쇼파에서만 비켜서 바로 앞에있는 식탁에서 1시간?정도 더 노래키고 술마시고 떠들다가 다른방 부부 분들 오시니까 바로 나갔어요 아무리 봐도 우리만 차별하나 싶고 동양인이라 그런건가 싶고, 두번다신 이용하고 싶지 않네요. 공간을 빌려줬음 서로 배려해서 쓰면되는데 에어비앤비를 할 자세가 안되있는거같다 최악의 호스트 최악의 에어비앤비인거같다."
14550581,Bushwick,Julia fue muy amable y ofreció todas las comodidades posibles. Su departamento es mejor de lo que se muestra en las fotos. Muy recomendable.
4359718,Bushwick,In 25min.von Wohnung in der Stadt  super. 
12544101,Bushwick,The room is really nice and the location close to the subway station. Toby was very helpful and trying to support me with information about the area and visiting NYC. It's a good place to stay if you're visiting Ney York.
8151183,Bushwick,"We had a great time there. Benjamin and Don were very attentive & friendly hosts. The appartment was very clean and actually decorated quite nicely. They even stocked up the fridge with beer, lemonade, butter, organic milk, eggs etc. and they brought us cake. And who doesn't like cake?

Beforehand we received a welcome package with loads of information about transportation and the immediate area as well as tips for food and stuff. WIFI was fast and reliable. Loads of TV entertainment. 

Metro is literally 2 minutes away, there is quite a large supermarkt next door.

Uhm, nothing really bad to say here. A great choice for your NY visit. 

"
1335634,Bushwick,Everything was as described and GiGi was an awesome host! Thank you!
8894773,Bushwick,From the first second I felt at home-also because of the nice welcoming! The room is just amazing-everything that you need to relax after bustling days in nyc! They introduced me to many nice people and showed me places to go to who are not in the lonely planet! Myo is an amazing cook- I loved to go to here events! Defenitly the place to stay in a great area in the city with nice hosts!
1760411,Chinatown,Thank you so much Lucie! You were very helpful and the place was great!
255650,Chinatown,Isabel was super easy to communicate with even though she was in Germany! Met a couple of her friends / neighbors who dropped me off the keys. Place was rad. Super minimal. Took a bath. Comfy bed. Would stay there again for sure.
9578683,Chinatown,This was our first airbnb stay and it was a great experience! Alex was very welcoming and helpful to provide all the information we could have wanted up front.  The apartment itself was conveniently located to two different subway stations and a nice walk to Chinatown and Little Italy. I would definitely recommend staying here.
869615,Chinatown,"Caroline was a great host. She greeted me like an old friend with a smile and a glass of wine -- even inviting me out to dinner with her friends. Although I couldn't attend because I'd already made other plans, it was a good indicator of how my stay would go. Her apartment was quiet and very conveniently located 2 blocks from the subway and a quick walk to the East River. If you're looking for a small place to call base camp while you explored NYC, I wouldn't look anywhere else! "
16085565,Chinatown,Immanuel is kind and his room was very comfortable. 
3913635,Chinatown,"Jake is a great host. Very friendly and made me feel at home. The apartments is located in a great place. I only stayed one night, but I definitely recommend. The bed is very comfortable too."
3602739,Chinatown,"Overall a nice, comfortable stay. Check-in was well organised, the apartment should be considered spacious for manhattan living and a great abundance of food at the doorstep."
12360660,Chinatown,"This place is located at 2 min walk from the subway station which makes it very convenient. The area is busy with commercial activity during the day and at the night the cleaning services are at work to tidy it up. 
Bob was very helpful upon check-in as mine was a last minute booking and I had privacy during my stay. Overall, good value for money."
778390,Chinatown,We had a nice stay at Sashas place. Room catches the sun very nicely and there is a lot to discover around Chinatown and LES.
2339096,Chinatown,I had a great time at Véronique's place after I missed my flight. The location of her flat was amazing - in lower east side you can find anything you want and it only takes few minutes of walk to the subway. And with her lovely lovely cat made my stay there just perfect. 
16393554,Chinatown,Erin's place is a designer's dream. Tons of space with minimal but exquisite decoration. Would recommend to anyone who appreciates beauty and would love to feel the true New York vibe. 
1475084,Chinatown,"Excellent host, and great communication. Spacious and very clean apartment was conveniently located. Thanks!"
939411,Chinatown,"We were running late due to flights and transit, and Bob was waiting for us at the apartment. He gave us a great overview of the neighborhood and transit and showed us everything we needed to know about the place. The only issue we had was with the occasional smells of cigarette smoke coming from downstairs. We were there for the marathon and it was kinda annoying. Besides that, the stay was great."
4097284,Canarsie,"Even before the check-in date, Leslie was very accommodating, patient and gave a timely response to all questions. The apartment was great, clean and safe. 2 families with 6 little kids and all had a place to sleep and play. My family really enjoyed their stay and Leslie's place added positively to their NYC vacation experience. Will definitely not mind coming back here again!"
1628156,Canarsie,"Très bon accueil et chaleureux. Hollis, le mari de Marlyn, nous a suivi à l'aeroport JFK pour rendre notre voiture de location et il nous a ramené dans sa voiture. Cela nous a évité de prendre des transports publics et tout ceci sans aucune obligation ou demande de notre part.
Le logement est mieux que sur les photos, très propre, lumineux et une cuisine extrêmement bien équipé; four, micro-ondes, appareil pour smoothies et popcorn etc.
 Il y a des draps, des serviettes et des articles dans la salle de bain.
Nous avions fait les courses avant mais nous avons trouvé un frigo plein de bonnes choses et une grande corbeille de fruits sur la table.
Pour ce qu'il est le quartier, comme nous sommes arrivés en voiture on est passé par une partie de la ville, pas très rassurant au début, mais là où habite Marlyn et Hollis, c'est très pavillonnaire et il n'y a vraiment pas de problème. Plusieurs fois nous sommes rentrés le soir et on ne s'est jamais senti mal à l'aise.
Le L-train est à 7 minutes à pied de l'appartement et on est au coeur de  Manhattan 35 minutes plus tard.
L'appartement a son propre entrée.
Deux petits points négatifs: comme on était 7 et les toilettes sont dans la salle de bain.... il fallait s'organiser. La rue est très passagère donc du bruit de la circulation.
Cela n'a certainement pas gâché notre semaine à New York, on a passé une très bonne semaine, grâce au bel appartement et la gentillesse de nos hôtes, qui d'ailleurs nous ont ramenés à JFK, avec 2 voitures à la fin de notre séjour!
C'est une adresse qu'on recommande vivement pour ceux qui restent plusieurs jours à New York.

"
42729,Carroll Gardens,"While communicating with Annette while in Brooklyn or after wasn't the best, I absolutely loved my time at her place. I can not stop raving about it to my friends.

I believe staying in such a lovely, clean home helped cement Carroll Gardens as a place I'd like to move.(I was neighborhood scouting on this trip)

Though the street noise wasn't ideal, you really can't beat the ease of walking to the subway or the charming neighborhood this apartment is located in.

I highly recommend Annette's places. They are spotless and beautifully decorated."
9473646,Carroll Gardens,"Sarah & Johannes were an absolute pleasure to stay with.   They keep an immaculately clean home.  They were friendly, welcoming, helpful and generous.  I loved the location and the accessibility.   Great neighborhood close to lots of yummy options and close to subway.  I couldn't be happier with my experience.  Thank you so much.   "
14661553,Carroll Gardens,"Loved this room! For the price and location, this is an amazing place to stay at if you're looking to visit the city or even for personal business. The bed was very comfortable, room was large, bathroom was modern and very well designed. Would love to come back and stay here in the future. "
1284776,Carroll Gardens,"My husband and I rented this apartment for our parents for 3.5 weeks following the birth of our new baby in July. It worked out *great,* and Angus was incredibly helpful, friendly, and responsive--a real delight of a host; we couldn't imagine anyone being better. The apartment was an excellent value as well--it has been gut-renovated and everything is in top condition. 

Here's a review from my mom, who stayed there for the majority of the time we rented it: ""This was a great apartment for us--roomy and bright in the common rooms, great location--convenient to the subway and safe walking around day and night, clean and fresh, comfortable with central air conditioning, and lots of helpful info for guests in the binder. The only down side was the downstairs shower--the water pressure was weak, so we only used it once. The upstairs shower worked great though, so this was only a minor inconvenience."""
23135,Carroll Gardens,"If you're looking for a great home base in a fantastic neighbourhood in Brooklyn, this is a great place to be. It's a short walk from the F train (which conveniently takes your right into the heart of Manhattan) and a slew of great neighbourhood stores, cafes, bars and restaurants. There were 4 of us that stayed here and we were all very happy with the apartment. Annette was great at communicating with us on how to get to and in the apartment. I'd highly recommend the House on Henry!"
1073635,Carroll Gardens,"Fantastische plek om te verblijven, netjes, schoon, kortbij metro. Zeker een plek om terug te gaan. Een aanrader!"
13732473,Chelsea,"We loved every minute of our ?visit! Excellent place! Clean, spacious, comfortable, and right in the center of Chelsea under the highline! Cant wait to be back and stay here again!!"
1892319,Chelsea,"Anya is one of the most considerate and helpful hosts I've met. She was extremely responsive and thorough before and after the check-in process even though she was out of town and little details in the room also showed how thoughtful and sweet she is. Cosy, clean and comfortable apartment (plus: bedsheets were extremely soft and comfortable!), right next to High Line, many cool cafes and Chelsea Market! Couldn't have found a better place to stay during my week in the city! "
2071420,Chelsea,"Staying in the Chelsea Brownstone was awesome.  A perfect location to explore NYC from. Close to the Highline, Chelsea Market, Penn Station, Empire State Building and of course the all important subway stops!  There's a supermarket around the corner, a good pizza place close and a pharmacy on the same street. Wade and Lisa's apartment was great - it was clean, homely, warm and safe. We'd strongly recommend staying with here, and found both Wade & Lisa to be accommodating when needed, but also willing to leave us to do our own thing too - a great mixture hosts to have.  You'll love staying here!"
8698671,Chelsea,"So enjoyed staying in a prime spot in New York City! Everything was within walking distance, and the city was right outside the front step ready to explore! I walked pretty much everywhere (up to Central Park down to the Memorial) and loved it! Tons of little bakeries, coffee shops, and restaurants right around the corner. The room was comfortable and had what was needed for my short stay. Jenn was wonderful, so welcoming, and helped make my stay incredible! "
4467771,Chelsea,"Tahir was an excellent host - quickly responsive to all our questions, and very warm and welcoming. The apartment was exactly as pictured - cozy, bright, clean, and comfortable. The Chelsea location made it easy to get around the city on foot or via subway, and the proximity to the High Line Park was a bonus, especially since the weather was so nice. Would definitely recommend."
6796474,Chelsea,"Great apartment, great host, great location "
1182187,Chelsea,"George was very helpful providing information about the neighborhood.  It was a nice, clean, comfortable room in an interesting neighborhood.  Highly recommended."
10903303,Chelsea,Great location.
8924988,Chelsea,Listing was 100% accurate..location is great..did the right choice picking up the place as I traveled without a car and everything worked out perfectly. Chelsea market right behind in the next block..amazing food there.
4615991,Chelsea,"Very accommodating hostess! Flat is lovely and in a great location. Be prepared for a walk up into the building and the flat on a first floor walk up, if you have a lot of luggage. We'd definitely rent again from Jennifer!"
2710634,Chelsea,"LiVi contacted us about arrival and was very helpful.  The description of apartment was accurate.  The apartment is small as most are in NYC but very clean and updated appliances and bathroom. Bed is comfortable. The location is superb.  Great deli on the corner for breakfast and any other quick meals.  Easy to access the subway to go uptown or downtown. Can walk to many places-Highline, Whitney Museum, over to Broadway and 5th Avenue.  The building and street are quiet.  The air conditioner in the living room was not as effective as the one in the bedroom.  Overall a great rental for our week in NYC.  We would be happy to rent with LiVi again.  Thank you.  Mary"
6124097,Chelsea,"Dimitri responded to questions quickly, he was on site to greet us and show us around. The apartment was exactly as shown, and exceeded my expectations. Great location, with easy access to mass transit and restaurants. Definitely will stay here again on my next trip to NYC. Thank you Dimitri for a wonderful stay."
966285,Chelsea,"Rob was the best airbnb host we've experienced. The apartment is very clean, and eclectic in the best way.  He went out of his way to meet us, help us with our bags, show us around, and even stocked the refrigerator with drinks and breakfast items.  He was otherwise available if we needed him, but we didn't.  The apartment is large by Manhattan standards and has everything you need.  It is a 5-story walk-up so be aware of that.  Location is incredible, 2 subway lines within a few blocks, plus an easy walk to many great neighborhoods.   We hope to stay here again soon. "
502132,Chelsea,"Amazing apartment. Anastasia was a great host, very helpful with things to check out and directions to get there. Would definitely recommend staying there. Rooftop is perfect for relaxing. Will stay again next time I'm in new York "
16107664,Chelsea,Alex was an excellent host- the most responsive I've experienced. The loft was quirky in a good way and an excellent home base for exploring the city. 
13913475,Chelsea,This studio worked out just great for the short trip my son and I took to NY. The apartment is  just as it appears in the pictures and Victor was very easy to communicate with. He even was very accommodating when I had flight delays. I would definitely stay here again.
10088658,Chelsea,"David is an incredible host, very attentive but not overbearing, just enough to make you feel welcome. He was very accomodating to changes in the arrival time and made us feel very welcome in his place. The place is small but comfy. The noise outside can get loud at night, but he has earplugs in the place (lots and lots of them) so that you can use them if the noise bothers you. However, I could sleep just fine. It was for of us, and while it was incredibly tight (David warned us), we managed just fine. The location is great, close to the subway and very cool neighborhoods. I would recommend it for up to 3 people unless you're fine with not having that much room. The TV worked perfect, so did the AC (a little loud since it´s right next to the bed, but I didn´t mind), and the bathroom was extremely clean, just the way I like it.
Overall a great experience."
1506911,Chelsea,"Ani was one of the most flexible hosts I've ever stayed with. My group was all arriving and leaving NYC at different times and she let us check-in early and when checking out, let me drop my bags so I could explore the city past the check out time. That was a huge relief to the trip. The space itself is very artsy and spacious - refreshing to see this much space in NYC! :) We had a great time. The only thing to note is that there is 1 master bedroom with a large bed, 1 bedroom with bunkbeds and the last ""bedroom"" is moreso of a living room with a pullout couch.  The location is also very prime! "
4709568,Chelsea,"Everything was fantastic!  Meritxell's home is beautiful, very clean, modern and comfortable.  

The space was perfect for two couples.  The bedrooms have some separation, beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are quite elegant.  Functional kitchen is open to the living room with seating to socialize and relax.  The bonus is the balcony, which has nice city views and is great for enjoying the weather (when it cooperates).

The area is nice.  While neighborhoods are pretty subjective, Chelsea is a good one.  We never felt unsafe, access to the Highline is right outside the door, and there are plenty of drinking and dining options within walking distance.  The A, C and E trains are a couple of blocks away and other transit options are convenient as well.

Meritxell went above and beyond to make our stay a good one; she happily obliged our check-in and check-out requests and touched base to make sure everything went smoothly. We would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend to others."
1811446,Chelsea,"Brian has thought of everything.  He had water out, restaurant recommendations, assorted travel size toiletries, the head on and lights on, etc.  Very thoughtful host.  The apartment is small, but the room is spacious and exactly as presented."
4297952,Chelsea,"James was there to welcome me and help carry my small bag up the last couple of flights of stairs.  The apartment is exactly as pictured, comfortable and cozy, and the location really can't be beat - close to Penn Station and far enough away from the craziness of Times Square to feel as though you're in a real neighborhood.  There are tons of restaurants (James will give you a list of his favorites nearby and the one I tried was great!) and the subway, at Penn Station, will take you just about anywhere you want to go.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
8456857,Chelsea,"This is a perfect location for a visit and long stay in the city! Ideal to get anywhere, we spent most of the week walking everywhere.
The flat is clean and the bed is SO comfortable! 
Thank you for such a great stay :) "
4803790,Chelsea,We had a great stay at Christoph's! He met us at the apartment after our early flight so we could put our bags away before exploring the city. He was very helpful and gave us a walk through of the apartment explaining everything. The apartment is quiet and cozy and in a perfect location with several subway entrances right around the corner. I would absolutely recommend staying at Christoph's to friends and would love to come back again myself! 
8206718,Chelsea,"Jannie was great with communication. The apartment is in a great location, very convenient to trains and in a safe neighborhood. The apartment was clean and had nice dimmable lighting. I enjoyed my stay and had no complaints."
11918887,Chelsea,"Ania was an EXCELLENT and easygoing host!!!! I put my older parents here for two nights and they had a great time. Quiet apartment, suitable for older couples too! Our arrival plans changed a few hours, but she was flexible with check in time. Room was very clean, no smell! She provided clean towels in the bathroom. There is a really cute small study room next to the room which my mom really liked to use to read in the morning. Would definitely book with her again! 
"
4205815,Chelsea,"Maria was a very friendly host. The place was clean. Enjoy her place in such an awesome city!

Something she can't control: construction was a little inconvenient at times!"
7225366,Chelsea,Great location. 
8193862,Chelsea,"Perfect location. Quiet basic room. This is the host room, that she rents when she is not there. There are two more rooms in the apt. occupied by two couples, but they were not (EMAIL HIDDEN)plete kitchen and shared bathroom. The place is pretty good if you are not to spend daytime in the room. If you only want the room to sleep in, it's fine. "
533927,Chelsea,"I really had a great stay at Michael's apt. Great Bed, TV, Shower.  All is clean !!!! And you are in the middle of Chelsea. Metro lines a couple of blocks away. Union Square and Flatiron District within walking distance. For me one of my favorite stay in NYC with Airbnb ! Great Apt and great location. Book it, you will not be disappointed."
7322,Chelsea,"Doti was great, very hospitable, the room a little smaller and busier than I expected (the apartment has a lot of stuff), but all in a fine room for the night."
658294,Chelsea,"Great communication prior to the stay. The apartment is lovely and as it looks in images. The location is really convenient. Bar/restaurant next door as well as laundry service, great mani/pedi called QQ across the street. Had a gust stay on the fold out sofa and we were still fine for space. Older building so the floors are a bit uneven but that's NYC for ya! Well appointed, enough closet/drawer space, kitchen was great."
822172,Chelsea,"I stayed with my friend ( Gabriel ) at the Archie's home by 5 days and i dont have too much to say. It was great.

The location is so great. maybe you coundn't find something like this at New York, it's near of everything and you can be free to walk to the best place of new york city aslo there is a CVS near to the apartament. It is very great if you wanna buy a few beers in the midnight.

Archie was a great host and he was attentive and thoughtful person. He lent us his metro card for the weeked and always he helped us a lot with everything that we need. Beedroom was clear and cosy.

I'd advice you without thinking about it.."
14711340,Chelsea,Riva was an great host and everything worked perfectly. I even was able to use the adapter to charge my computer as I forget it in Europe. Just amazing. 
1732322,Chelsea,"This place is a great value in a great area, central to everything and steps away from the subway. Communication was excellent, the place was clean with all you need for a comfortable stay. The bed is comfy and we slept great. Others discussed street noise but that wasn't an issue for us. Feel confident booking this place!"
550297,Chelsea,"Excellent location, excellent hosts.  Rooms clean and well kept and linen and towels were fresh.  My only suggestion for people booking this property; travel light! know that this is a 6 flight walk up; big/heavy luggage not recommended.  Other than that shortcoming, excellent stay here."
16016486,Chelsea,"Great place, very comfortable. Will stay here again "
5918653,Chelsea,Made this booking for our corporate clients -- Ben was quick to respond and easy to work with. Instructions and key pick up was pretty clear and went smoothly for the most part. Would rent from Ben again. 
5068702,Civic Center,This place was pretty awesome. Luykan was very accommodating with our visit and helped make my vacation to NYC that more enjoyable by eliminating that extra stress level. The Loft was very nice with plenty of space. Very close to the subway lines to help get you moving along. There was also an Apple TV which helped pass the time while waiting for friends to get ready. Had a steady diet of How I Met your Mother. Would highly recommend. Thanks Luykan!!!
310272,Clifton,"Jonathan waited up for us to arrive and great us into his home, his dog barks alot when you first arrive, but then quickly warms up to you when your eating :)   It was a nice visit, thanks Jonathan."
67130,Clinton Hill,"Amazing place with an amazing host! the Neighborhood is good, good beer and good pizza.
Oh, and the cat is very cool!"
225926,Clinton Hill,"We had a lovely stay , the neighborhood around the house was great , coffee shops and restaurants etc and close to transport links to Manhatten . Walk to Dumbo and get the ferry cheap and fun"
442633,Clinton Hill,"My mother and I had a great stay at Ryan's apartment. The place was very homey and eclectically decorated, and it was very clean and well taken care of. Getting the keys from the nearby cafe was super convenient. We would definitely stay again!"
8069030,Clinton Hill,"This was the most perfect place to stay! Yes, the place is exactly as you see in the pictures – even better. It's HUGE! I felt like I almost got lost in there in the beginning. The kitchen is twice  as big as a normal NYC-flat and on top of that there is the even bigger living room with flat screen TV and the three bedrooms, all of them really big as well. 

I came to New York with two colleagues and this was perfect for us. We had one bedroom each with huge closet space and a lot of clean towels. The two bathrooms both with shower and WC also made it easy for us getting ready on time in the morning. Very good for three girls...

And John was the perfect host. When we came, John had made sure there were fresh fruit, crackers, cheese and chilled rosé waiting for us, and even two bouquets of fresh roses! Just wonderful. And through half of our stay, he even made sure to have our bed sheets changed for fresh ones, give us new towels, new fresh flowers and some new treats, without us even asking. Felt like a hotel. Too kind!

The apartment is completely new with new furniture, super clean (no shoes allowed inside – as a Swede I love that)  and has very effective air conditioning in each room which was appreciated! In the kitchen there were all the utensils you might need. The keyless system to get through the door is also very clever – no worries about loosing keys or need to share one key between several guests. Also one super important thing: it was so quiet. The flat is on the top floor (two stairs, no lift) and we never heard a thing from either the street, the neighbors or each other. 

The place is within walking distance to Manhattan bridge or Brooklyn bridge and to walk from the doorstep to Manhattan/China town took us about 40mins. The G line is about a 5 min walk away (and there are bus stops all around) and there are several bars, cafés, restaurants and delis just around the corner to buy food and groceries. The neighborhood, Clinton hill, is one of my favorites, not as hipster or expensive as Williamsburg but instead with genuine good places to eat and shop, and super safe (of course), but very close to both Bushwick and Williamsburg. My favorite borough to stay in in Brooklyn for sure.  

The host, John, always replied swiftly on messages and was very helpful and generous throughout. He always made sure we had everything. We could not have had a better host, I am so happy to have stayed at his place and would not hesitate one bit to come back again next year.  

And last but not least: the wi-fi was also really good, a strong connection and never any problems. Good when you are traveling :)

Hope to come back again!"
8144148,Clinton Hill,"Not the tidiest place but comfortable and near to public transportation.
The host Justin was great and showed us around. Thanks so much!"
356723,Clinton Hill,Fantastic space that's even better in person. The pictures can't do justice to the scale or the decor. Julian was accommodating and communication was great. I'd recommend booking for an entire weekend.
6132757,Clinton Hill,Alma was really kind. She did her best to make us feel at home. The room is big and the bed is comfortable. The location of the apartment is great. Subway line C is just in front of the door and brings you to Manhattan in just 20'. The building is a bit old though and the heating system was surprisingly noisy.
9413809,Clinton Hill,"Melanie's place was nothing short of perfect. It was conveniently located with a subway stop, grocery, and several bars and restaurants all within short walking distance. Melanie was extremely responsive and easy going and everything was set up perfectly. I would 100% stay here again or recommend to a friend."
5885396,Clinton Hill,"Graham & Ben are my the best!
They are my #1 goto when needing a  room for myself, or when friends & family visit NYC.  Ben & Graham are very professional  with style & class. Rooms are 5 star in my opinion.  
I would definitely recommend."
6880184,Clinton Hill,"Michael's place was fantastic. A very comfortable space, a walking distance from the Metro, and great communication with the host despite not meeting him face-to-face. Recommend without hesitation!"
828796,Clinton Hill,"My friends and I spent two night here, it's nice and fully equipped. The location is great, only minutes from a subway station. "
299521,Clinton Hill,"Clean,comfortable and exactly what you expect from fotographs. Near train.Well comunicated. Neighbourhood it's ok with nice places yo diner or breakfast. Probably it's not the best part of Brooklyn but we went with children  and didn't have any problem"
1918693,Clinton Hill,"Thank you so much! This was such a great experience to stay in your lovely house in Brooklyn! Thank you for all the help you gave  to me and my wife! Greetings from Germany, Fabian and Jasmin "
1442799,Clinton Hill,"The apartment was as described, clean, sun filled and spacious.  All linen, towels, toilet rolls etc were provided. Good bathroom and air conditioning which was needed in the hot humid conditions in September. We were a party of four, with one sleeping on the very comfortable sofa bed in the sitting room.  Tatiana and her husband made us feel very welcome and responded to requests promptly.  Great neighbourhood for food and good access to nearby subway stations.I would recommend very highly."
13604323,Clinton Hill,"I spent a month in Melanie's apartment with my partner. We had such a brilliant time and would highly recommend it! The apartment itself has so much character, with really light, bright rooms, high ceilings, loads of space for 2 people and Melanie's beautiful paintings on the walls. There was also a full range of books and a fully equipped kitchen. Melanie was a great host and couldn't do enough to ensure we enjoyed our stay. We were both working from the apartment and so needed good internet and power connections for our laptops. Melanie was happy to oblige with making sure it met our needs. She also gave us great advice on where to go in the local area and lent us sledges when it snowed. 

The area itself is a fantastic introduction to Brooklyn. There are so many good restaurants, bars and cafes on Vanderbilt, Fulton and Dekalb that it is hard to know where to start.  Our favourites were Benys for breakfast, Choice Market for lunch, Cafe Dosa for Indian, Smoking Monkey for drinks and oysters and Luanne's for vegan dining. I also spent a lot of time at the local yoga studio, DouYoga which I'd recommend as they had great teachers. 

So, don't miss the opportunity to stay in this amazing apartment. You won't regret it! "
3831,Clinton Hill,"LisaRoxanne met us out on the sidewalk, and was right there to answer the phone as we passed with help for parking. She was very down to earth and friendly! Her little son we met is adorable! "
31994,Clinton Hill,"Our trip to New York ended at Waldemar's place. 
The welcome was very good as he gave us a tour of the house + our room explaining how everything worked and where everything was.
He is not invasive and as we were out early in the morning and back in around 8pm we didn't see him much. We still had the chance to have a quick chat and he seemed a very nice person. 

The room itself was huge, there is a big space in the middle which was great for us to arrange our suitcases etc. A scale was also available to weight our suitcases. 
The bed was big and we slept really well. 
The En Suite bathroom was also very appreciated as it was big and clean. 
The + was the small 'balcony' with the table and chairs, although we didn't have the chance to really spend time on it. 

His house is located VERY close to the subway. Within 20 minutes and 1 change you could hit times Square or Penn Station. 
Brooklyn itself is nice visiting and the street is very quiet and welcoming. 

The other good thing was the small supermarket accross the street where they had good salads and fresh sandwiches. 

We enjoyed our stay.

29628,Clinton Hill,"
La estancia fue muy cómoda, la habitación está mucho mejor que en la fotografía, la cama muy confortable y todo muy práctico, en todo momento nos contestaron a los mensajes enviados, nos ayudaron a llegar al apartamento y luego nos mostraron la casa con mucha amabilidad, nos indicaron lugares para comer cerca, todo muy bien, nos hicieron sentir como en nuestra casa.
El barrio estaba bien, el metro muy cerca del apartamento, en la misma calle."
414801,Clinton Hill,"Cool loft, comfortable accommodations, nice vintage decor - great  space for our group of 6 (and then some). Thanks for having us Shell!"
57297,Cobble Hill,We had good time by Sheila's apt. Bed is big and convenient for s couple. The neighborhood is nice & quiet. A better light in the living room will do but all the rest is ok
1144861,Cobble Hill,"Lucien met us at the gallery downstairs, showed us to the apartment, answered our questions, and told us to call him if we needed anything.  He was gracious and helpful.  The apartment is bohemian ..just as advertised ..very comfortable.  The bed was very good, towels fresh, kitchen equipped.  The location is excellent for enjoying Brooklyn's many amenities or for going into Manhattan.  There is a subway station just across Smith street and it is a nice walk to any of the neighborhoods.  We put our car in a garage a few blocks away and walked everywhere. My husband and I came into town for our grand daughter's bat mitzvah, and we were on the go all weekend with the family.  We did not eat in as most meals were part of the event.  And there are really too many wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood!  For us the only drawback was we could not get a quick shower before going to the next event because the charming footed bathtub has a hand held shower and was better for a relaxing bath than a quick duck under the shower.  That said, next time I just may take a long soak in that tub and have a more leisurely visit.  Note:  this is a two story walkup, so if you have knee problems, you might not like it.  We are in our seventies and did not have any trouble with it."
836720,College Point,Manuel communicated all the details in a timely fashion. He made a point to meet us upon our arrival.
4171692,Crown Heights,Steven's place is a great price for a nice apartment in an easily accessible location
5430017,Crown Heights,"We had a very nice stay here and German made us feel at home. He was also very patient as we had our little Baby with us crying sometimes in the night. Thanks, German!"
11243074,Crown Heights,"Adam and Julia were accommodating from the start! I had an emergency and needed to enter the space in the morning. Adam responded to my request quickly. He even waited a little longer to go to work, so, that he could show me around and give me the keys! The space is very beautiful and quite clean. I was offered yogurt, granola, and coffee. It's tranquil, too, and having the entire space to one's self is fantastic! The space is very modern, too!  You will not regret staying here! "
643328,Crown Heights,"We staid at Demi's place for 7 nights and it was absolutely cosy and enjoyable. The place is really spacious and equipped with nice furniture, the neighborhood is great. Within a few minutes walking distance or subway ride you'll find everything you need.
We only met Demi very briefly during our check-in as we have been wandering throughout the city everyday. But we knew she was available when needed.  She also checked up on us after a few days which was very kind. The place is definitely highly recommended."
1971239,Crown Heights,"We had an excellent experience at the apartment. I didn’t meet personally with Mapa only my family met with Oscar. He was very nice and helpful. The apartment is very clean and spacious (like the pictures). It is very close to metro station, we used metro all the time. I can highly recommend this apartment for staying. Thank you Mapa!"
14041447,Crown Heights,"Marisha is a wonderful host! The apartment is very well located in Kingston avenue, the room is nicely decorated and has all appliances and a heater, the bed was so comfortable! Marisha makes her hosts feel home; I definitely recommend her place that I will no hesitate to reserve on my next trips to NYC ! A big thank you Marisha ;)"
6360200,Crown Heights,"Séjour parfait chez Jared et sa famille!

Quartier accessible par 2 stations de métro différentes qui desservent Manhattan et les autres quartiers de Brooklyn. Une rue calme parfaite pour se reposer, avec toutes les commodités nécessaires à quelques pas!
Pour l'appartement, ce sont bien 3 pièces, une grande cuisine, une chambre, un salon comprenant un immense placard. Le tout en très bon état et propre.
Le gros avantage c'est que les hôtes vivent au rez de chaussée et sont disponibles facilement pour toute question ou conversation!

Communication facile via sms ou mail avec Jared pour le ""check-in"" et aucune contrainte pour le ""check-out"".

Je recommande vivement cette location!
"
7461611,Crown Heights,"This is a great place for a single traveler, wonderful location yet quiet enough to hear the birds early in the morning and people actually say hello when you walk in the street. True story. Lisa made me feel very welcome, stocked up the fridge with water and the place pretty much everything else I needed. As it's a basement apartment there is not much daylight, but if you spend your time in Brooklyn and the rest of the city then really: what are you doing inside?"
15028194,Crown Heights,"Very good value overall.  Zach very responsive and helpful.  Not exactly 'stylish', though, more like a quirky student pad, but laid back and comfortable. Kitchen very rudimentary but functional.   Ok location; 15 min walk from L line to Manhattan; hip Brooklyn central not within walking distance."
4678568,Crown Heights,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Maireni's home. The room was just as described, location was really great too. Maireni was a great host and accommodating as well. Thank you!"
7179646,Crown Heights,"Nice place and very kinde people, we hope to come back again in Brooklyn to our new friend."
7771156,Crown Heights,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6658271,Crown Heights,Great place if you just want some place to sleep and your planning to explore the city.
10595374,Crown Heights,"What an amazing experience. We just spent more than 2 weeks exploring New York and absolutely loved staying in this beautiful home. The pictures on the website just do not do this home justice. It is obvious that the owners take great pride in their home. For the space and amenities, this home is a real bargain.

The neighborhood is pretty quiet (for New York) and the subway is a very short walk away. We had no issues reaching any of the popular New York landmarks. If you have a car, there is plenty of street parking.

The hosts were available and attentive to the few issues that we encountered during our stay and gave us all the space that we needed to enjoy our vacation.

We are already looking forward to our next visit and will definitely stay here again (if it is available)."
2017397,Crown Heights,"The appartment is really amazing, an industrial loft in an upcoming neighborhoud. It is very well equiped, everything you need is there, even an adaptor for the powerplug. The appartment is also very big, there is plenty of space for relaxing, having dinner etc. 
Because the appartment is in the basement, there's not much daylight, but because of the good positioning of the numerous lamps in the loft that was not a problem at all. 
Monica was very helpfull and kind, she even picked us up at the airport, because she had to be there anyway. Thanks again Monica!
The appartment is near to Franklin station subway with a direct connection to Manhattan. It's nice to sleep in a more quite neighborhoud after being a whole day in noisy Manhattan. 
We would definitely stay here again when we visit NYC! "
512210,Crown Heights,"Rich was a great host and help for our week in New York. We were late getting into JFK but Rich still greeted us with a smile and some snacks for our late arrival. His house is amazing and has a lot of space, especially as we were the only two people staying at the time. We were in town for a wedding located in north Brooklyn, Rich's house was perfectly located and made it a breeze to get to anywhere we had to be. Rich was also nice enough to provide us transport details and information about the neighborhood (shops, bars, restaurants etc) which made our stay so much easier. Overall Rich was an amazing host and could easily be reached if we needed anything, his place was comfortable and an amazing place to stay for a week. I just wish we had more time, I will definitely be coming back and would recommend to anyone. "
53016,Crown Heights,"Nilea, is amazing. She is super welcoming with a wonderful and conveniently located home, that was well furnished and had plenty of amenities and charm (that was very true to its description). The neighborhood is incredible with an insane amount of eating/drinking options. My only suggestion is to come here in the cooler months, with no window AC or central cooling it makes for a balmy summer stay. Other than that it is excellent."
6749285,Crown Heights,"very good place
large area and enlightened very confortable and near the shops and metro"
2716889,Crown Heights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Clayons apartment. The apartment is comfortable, modern furnished and near to the subway stations. Clayon is a very nice host and if we had any problems she directly helped us. :) we would really recommend this place! "
1112070,Crown Heights,"We had a wonderful time in NYC and we stayed ten days at Autumn's apartment. There you have everything you need, a large and comfortable bed, an own bathroom, a kitchen. Manuel and Autumn are very helpful if you want to know anything aboout the surroundings. It's a safe area in Brooklyn, you can walk around at night or use the subway at any time. You can find the Botanical Garden and the Brooklyn Museum next to the apartment and there are many supermarkets, restaurants and the nearest subway station is just five minutes away where you get in twenty minutes to Manhattan. All in all it is a good place to discover NYC and we enjoyed our vacation."
12835664,Crown Heights,Place was awesome. We were very pleased and everything was as described. The host's communication was great and we found this to be an outstanding value. We would absolutely recommend.  
13432851,Crown Heights,"Las casa se encontraba en perfectas condiciones, acogedora con una excelente distribución de habitaciones, los baños sensacionales, limpios y agradables. La cocina era perfecta, casi no la usamos pero nos encanto que tuviera todos los servicios mencionados a nuestra disposición como lo es el regfrigerador, estufa y sandwichera. 
Podría señalar que las fotos no reflejan lo bonito que es el departamento. La casa se ubica a dos cuadras de la estación crown-utica, lo cual nos permitia movernos a cualquier punto, cerca de la casa hay tiendas y restaurantes.
En cuanto a la atención de Zohan, ella fue muy atenta desde el primer instante y estuvo al pendiente en todo momento de lo que necesitamos. Recomiendo ampliamente este departamento."
570750,Crown Heights,"Noemie and her husband made us feel extremely welcome at their urban retreat in Brooklyn. We will absolutely come back here again, as it was a great place for my kids (minimal, well-appointed furniture, kid-friendly, little to no fragiles) and my elderly mother (no stairs to climb, and again, well-appointed furnishings and with well-equipped appliances).

The apartment was exactly as described and pictured, and we felt very secure. Inside was also spotless and most everything was easy to find and use. Any questions we had, Noemie was very quick in reaching and responding to us, and very accommodating in making sure we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable as well. The biggest challenge of our trip was having a car, and Noemie and Robert were extremely generous in letting us use their driveway when we needed it. Again, we would love to come back and make this our home base in Brooklyn on our next trip to NYC!"
3359768,Crown Heights,Michelle's directions and messages got me there and settled without any issues. The house and room were great and Michelle herself was very warm a friendly. A great stop for a short stay. 
4945459,Crown Heights,"Noah responded really quickly to my request to grab the room that night, and was quick to give me directions and assistance. He was really welcoming and a lifesaver to allow me to use his place on such short notice!  Good place, comfortably sleeps 3 people and in a convenient location!"
873701,Crown Heights,"Great location. You can perfectly relax in the spacious, nicely decorated apartment situated in a beautiful little street & calm neighborhood, yet with many nice places like bars, coffee shops and restaurants so close. We received a discount because the second room we booked initially would not be available for the whole time of our stay. In the end however, Becky and her husband even allowed us to make use also of the second room until our departure. They were very helpful and friendly."
1525602,Crown Heights,"L'appartamento è molto carino e non manca nulla, la metro è a 2minuti a piedi e in 15.20minuti sei in times squere..."
9253112,Crown Heights,"Helga -- and her apartment -- were totally great. Everything was a super breeze... booking, getting keys, settling in, the whole nine. She's great!

The apartment itself is gorgeous, and right in my fave part of Brooklyn, Crown Heights. Lots of dope restos and coffee shops but with none of Williamsburg's pretence. 

Would totally stay here again. And you should too!"
11993790,Crown Heights,"....i decided to continue my stay at Daniel's , he's so amazing , his place can be anyone's home away from home (it sure was mines."
4345691,Crown Heights,"The Room was nice and clean and so was the place. It has four to five rooms from the basement to the 2nd floor, a good kitchen and the checkin process is well organised, except that the front door code didnt work right away, but we could figure that out with Miguel in just a few minutes on the phone. He was really nice and friendly and had an open ear for all questions. The place is close to the subway (the blue A, C; E line). Getting to Manhattan is quite a journey (30 to 50 min, dependig where you want to go) but in exchange the price for the Brownstone room is very fair by NYC standards. The House is in a sidestreet but close to Nostrand Ave and Fulton St. and there are plenty of shops, laundry places, fast food joints and the likes. We would stay there again, it was awesome and the hosts were great, even thought they live far away and are only to be seen two or three times a week."
10365373,Crown Heights,"Krysta and her roommate were both kind and polite. We felt very welcome in their apartment. Great location; I felt safe there (not used to the big city so this was important to me) and it was close to diverse food options, great yoga studio, and the subway. I would absolutely recommend."
2232697,Crown Heights,Great host and really beautiful apartment! Katarina is an excellent host with a nice taste in decoration. The apartment is clean and close to metro line which provides easy access to Manhattan.  I really enjoyed my stay there!
8521666,Crown Heights,"Candice was very accommodating and flexible, even when we ended up in traffic and being later than we expected. She was friendly and welcoming, but also professional. The room was very convenient to the metro and it was easy to find parking on the street. Wifi was available and reliable. The bed was very comfortable!"
5641644,Crown Heights,"Great people , great place , very nice and clean place it is cozy small room.  Metro/ train is 5 mints walk and you ll find bars and Cafe just around the corner. Very friendly and social neighbor hood with Nightlife. Tommy respected my Concerns and was respectful. Room can be upgraded . It is small and comfortable but lacks few things like closet or table but again it is subjective opinion and Tommy offers solutions to problems. He replied quick and extended my stay request on short notification. i look forward to coming here again definitely."
8458793,Crown Heights,"Megan's apartment was great for our stay in New York. Even after long days walking through the city sightseeing we liked the very comfortable bed. 
Megan cared for us at any time, if there were questions, thank you!
We can recommend Megan and her Apartment!!"
6837687,Crown Heights,"All the information provided on its website is correct, the neighborhood is nice and very convenient for its proximity to the NY subway, I had the opportunity to meet Denise  and I found a great person and really was like I was in my own house , many thanks, excellent recommendation"
4346952,Crown Heights,I was unable to meet Mariama but Miguel was very kind and accommodating and the space was gorgeous and very well maintained. Our room was a little smaller than we expected but once another room became available in the building Miguel happily upgraded us to a larger space (plus the additional cost) with no worries at all.  The community space was adorable! The kitchen was easy to use and very inviting. It felt like home - which in the middle of winter in Brooklyn is a nice feeling. This being my veery first Air BnB experience I can definitely say it was well worth it. Anyone looking to book in this area of Brooklyn would do themselves a favor to book with Miguel & Mariama. 
712136,Concord,"I am a Polish physician and the purpose of my stay at Marianne's house was a residency interview at SIUH. The stay fully met my expectations and I am happy to sincerely recommend Marianne to anyone who seeks a peaceful homestay in Staten Island.

Location: The house is located in a quite close proximity to the hospital, which made the cab fare less than 10 bucks one way. This is a residential neighborhood and the area looks safe and nice. There is a Polish deli shop within 15 minutes of walking distance, as well as many other shops and restaurants.

The place: The house is quite cozy and nicely furnished. The room, as well as the bathroom and the kitchen were clean. The place looked exactly the same as could be seen in the pictures. I can recommend the place to people who are allergic to dust, as I had no reaction. It was warm during nighttime. You will have access to all basic kitchen facilities, including a coffee brewer. The only con: the house is very acoustic and sounds coming from downstairs can be easily heard upstairs.

The host: Marianne is a very nice and flexible person who is always willing to help you. She actually lives in the house and is readily accessible. Witnessing the host's everyday life allows you to consider the place a true homestay. Her friendliness combined with non-intusiveness makes her an almost perfect host to stay at."
4302970,Concourse,Host was very communicative ahead of time. Room was clean and comfortable. Neighborhood is great. Very easy to get to from the train. 
846671,Concourse Village,"Michelle was an exceptional host, she went out of her way to make sure I had a pleasant stay in her apartment. I didn't make to her place until 4AM yet she stayed in touch and waited up for me to get there. The place is super clean and in a great location only a few minutes on foot to Yankee stadium! I highly recommend this great apartment and even nicer host! "
229668,Corona,"Lorna was an amazing host. She was incredibly attentive, responded quickly and was immensely patient and flexible when my plans changed and my check in time moved later. The room was exactly as advertised, spacious, comfortable and private. She provided all the necessities and truly made me feel welcome. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a place to stay. It is close to the subway and othe public transit, two stops from Citi Field and in an active neighborhood (try the street food). If I could give 6 stars I would. "
3081756,Corona,"I really enjoyed the stay at Alis place. When I arrived he helped to find something to eat and buy groceries. The room was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can see the sunrise from the bed. The location of the appartment is quite good, you are in less than one hour with the subway in Manhattan. I can recommend this room to everyone who needs a good and affordable place in New York."
4575364,Cypress Hills,"Carmen is really nice and joyful. The place is great cause near the subway. The neighborhood is calm and cute. The only problem was that sometime sharing one bathroom with 8 people can be hard to manage, you have to wait in line for the restroom and sometimes people don't flush.. But otherwise everything was great and again, Carmen is really nice!"
9021705,Cypress Hills,"The stay I had in Carmens airbnb was the best I ever had in one. You sleep in a little sleeping pot on a double bed. That gives you more privacity, when you don't know the people. But because of the little chill out areas inside or outside you get to know the people you living with fast. I met Carmen on the last day on my stay, after I checked out and she was the nicest person to talk to. She gave me insiders about the neigbourhood and the city itself. The rooms get cleaned everyday, what makes it even better."
613818,Cypress Hills,"Very welcoming host and a great help during my stay!! Will book again next time I am in the NYC area!! 

Thanks"
4070025,DUMBO,"This place is STUNNING. Shahram welcomed my school-age daughter and I as family.  He was there when we checked in, showed us around, and even gave my girl a notebook and pencils.  His place was gorgeous but user-friendly; everything was the very most modern but not too clever that one couldn't figure it out.  Even as a local, I learned new things! Shahram also answered every silly question within minutes.  During a time of upheaval, while renovating our local apt, Shahram gave my daughter and I a home away from home. STAY HERE!"
7388240,Downtown Brooklyn,"I had a lovely time in Gabriela's apartment, I felt very welcome and the food provided was an unexpected added bonus. The apartment was very clean and the roof top was really amazing. Only thing I would change would be having a location within Manhattan however the walk into Manhattan is lovely. Great host, great place would, definitely stay here again. "
605947,Downtown Brooklyn,"Ezio's apartment is fantastic. I almost hesitate to review it so I can stay here more often :-)  It's extremely spacious, great for cooking, and the little details like the 2nd bathroom and washer and dryer are super nice. There's especially good light from the massive windows. 

Very responsive and kind host!"
7094346,Downtown Brooklyn,"Gabriela is good to response to guests and really helpful for everything! And the room and the bathroom was clean and cozy :) Also I really liked the location. It is near to the subway station, many restaurants, and bars! But there are elevator hours so it could be a bit annoying if you have any big luggages :("
3420546,Dyker Heights,Vera was an awesome host! Warm and welcoming. Would stay again.
8168619,East Elmhurst,Consistent and great every stay. 
973535,East Elmhurst,"Everything went very well on our trip. The location is excellent for seeing the US Open and for exploring Manhattan; the bus stop is near and it takes you to the metro with which you can pretty much go anywhere you like. We also always felt safe in the neighbourhood, didn't see anything suspicious during the two weeks we stayed there. The nearby shopping center was good to have.

The apartment had everything we needed, the Mac Mini is a nice touch and very useful. Wifi was pretty good also. Whenever we needed to ask something Gonzalo or Nora were quick to answer our messages. We also got useful tips on how to get around and what to do in the city.

Thanks Gonzalo and Nora for making us feel welcome!"
7037918,East Elmhurst,"I stayed one night, the room was very spacious and clean. The house is literally 3 minute drive from LaGuardia and it's extremely convenient. Carmen was a great host, she came out to the street to meet me when I couldn't see the house number in the dark, her family was very friendly and welcoming."
8972426,East Elmhurst,"Yes, Sarah made me feel very welcome. She was very pleasant and helpful. If there was anything I needed she answered me and was able to help out promptly and quickly "
4885045,East Elmhurst,"Armando was a great host. He was easy to contact, stayed in touch and made sure that I got in for my late arrival and had everything I needed once I had arrived. Location was up a couple of flights of stairs and some narrow hallways. It was modest but definitely as advertised and suited my needs well. "
7125107,East Elmhurst,"Maya is very responsive and helpful. She provides clear instructions for everything in her place. She is very welcoming. Her cookies and bagels are great. Her rooms are clean and the heater works very well. There is a bus stop right in front of the house which takes you to the subway, which is very convenient. It takes up to 1-1.5 hour to go Manhattan.
This is my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. Would recommend her place to people who want to find an affordable place to stay and explore New York. "
62095,East Flatbush,"Colette and Sean were very kind and discrete hosts with good tips for New York and other locations in the US of A (e.g. Philadelphia, Washington D.C.). I liked the neighbourhood too, as it is an authentic, non-gentrified place, remote, but not far from the attractions of Manhattan and Brooklyn. And if you take the subway to Newkirk Avenue: always pop into one of the supermarkets nearby the exit of the station and grab one of them tasty mangoes shipped in from haiti. besides it is hard to find healthy food in NY anyway, it seems - in one case the ""time out"" magazine the hosts gave me helped me a lot finding good food. So: thanks Colette and Sean. See you around. Take care."
15469713,East Flatbush,great place
1089542,East Flatbush,"I didn't have a lot of interaction with them, since I wasn't actually there very much, but they were a lovely family - very nice, with adorable and well-behaved kids.  Karen had left a very helpful and detailed printout with information about restaurants, airport transport info, etc.  "
15846039,East Flatbush,"I found cockroaches everywhere. Not only in the kitchen but also inside the toilet. It was really disgusting living there. I would not come back unless you love living among insects.
When I told the host that, he said that the only bugs that were there were his guests. It was not very nice from him.
El apartamento está lleno de cucarachas, en la cocina, en el baño, dentro del retrete... no recomendaría este lugar.
Cuando le conté al propietario mi opinión acerca del apartamento, él me dijo que los únicos bichos que entraban en su casa eran los propios huéspedes... no es una persona muy buena, supongo"
4341158,East Flatbush,Leatha was great and so was her place!  She was able to accommodate a last minute trip and even had the fridge stocked with food!  Very nice and quite neighborhood in brooklyn and she provide parking!!! Clean apartment and the pictures are accurate.  Public transportation is close by and it's not too far from JFK. 
1056185,East Flatbush,"Christa and Zach were lovely hosts with two adorable dogs which made the experience even more delightful. The room was warm and cozy with a guide and several books on NY. Communication was excellent before, after, and during. A little warning for others with large suitcases - there's a couple of staircases out the front but with a big burly friend you should be okay! "
9079871,East Flatbush,"Beautiful, spacious home with large kitchen. In case of problems it is very quick to respond . excellent location"
3862328,East Harlem,"Great apartment, short walk to Central Park, subway close by, comfy bed and good shower. Nice local neighbourhood, good base for exploring NYC."
1297637,East Harlem,"Portus made me very very welcome. He was really flexible with my arrival and departure arrangements and all contact before arriving was really easy. 
The apartment was immaculately clean and just as described - bigger even. 
The neighbourhood was FANTASTIC and I had the best time here of all my time in the US. This was due to both the apartment and the area.
My only regret was that because of my schedule, I did not meet Portus until my final day in NYC. When we met we talked so much I nearly missed my flight! 
What a great place and great host!"
14989532,East Harlem,"The apartment is spacious and properly furnished. The location is very convenient, wide offer of shops and services, 100mt from subway 6 that connects you with the whole Manhattan area and more. Last but not least the owners are fantastic, always available for any support needed; Lovely children as well!

Definitively recommended.

6130778,East Harlem,They are really nice people. there was a problem with the window in our room but we switched to the other room then was ok. The location is a bit far from the subway station if u consider subway as an primary transportation measure to travel in NYC.
640990,East Harlem,"Super expérience, la chambre est spacieuse et agréable, et Diego très amical. A recommander sans hésitation, c'est un très bon rapport qualité-prix pour New York, et le métro à proximité permet de rejoindre facilement les sites touristiques de Manhattan."

16974,East Harlem,"What a trip!  Robin is the most gracious hostess In NYC.  Her SpaHa Loft was incredible, Spacious and the pictures do not do it justice.  Everything you need she has provided....Fresh Linens, Towels, Iron & Ironing board, washer and Dryer, a handy Instruction guide to access the Internet, Bus routes, Subway, you name it she provides. 

This was my first Airbnb experience and I must admit I was a bit skeptical, especially when my first host cancelled My reservation due to plumbing (URL HIDDEN) the last minute........That is where Robin took the reins and was an angel to host myself and my daughter, The SpaHa loft is such a cozy space where you can relax after exploring the city.

Words cannot express how much fun we had!

Thank you Robin,

Shannon and Grace

We will definitely use the loft again on our next trip to NYC!

O lugar é perfeito, pertinho de metrô, cafés, mercados e farmácias e dá para ir caminhando até o Central Park, o que nos foi perfeito. A vizinhança é segura possibilitando caminhar tarde da noite sem nenhum problema. Recomendo! "
13206851,East Harlem,"Sarah was more than welcoming when we arrived to the apartment and throughout the weekend. She offered tips for things to do, ways to commute, and assistance at any time we may have needed it. The location was exactly as described: perfect. Lots to do and eat in the area, and the nearby subway provided a convenient way to explore the rest of the city. Coming from out of town we felt extremely safe here. It was a great experience from a great host."
8799559,East Harlem,"So enjoyed our stay at Sofia's.  Lovely apt with a great view.  Comfortable, clean bedroom. And all for a great price.  Sofia has done a great job of organizing for the needs her guests.  Highly recommend!"
11352664,East Harlem,Sabia was a great host to my girlfriend and I! The apartment is advertised well and a great value. I highly recommend this listing for those looking to explore the city! Her notes and directions were all laid out very plain and simple. The communication was very professional and punctual. 
1164111,East Harlem,"LaNola's place is great. We have not had the chance to meet her in person but her sister Michelle looked after everything perfectly. LaNola even taught her how to make scones. BTW very very delicious. Subway is just 1 block away and next to a starbucks. The flat is clean and cosy and we would always like to come back. 
Thanks for letting us be your guests."
4162997,East Harlem,Rick and Matt were very welcoming and professional hosts. The room was clean and well presented and we had two good nights of sleep. It's not too close to downtown but there's plenty transport nearby. All in all it was a very good place to stay .
5783899,East Harlem,"Sarah’s place was super clean, communication was great and she even accommodated an early check-in time.

237734,East Harlem,"What a fantastic experience! Doe is a great host. He was very flexible with our check in time (we had flight cancellations), and also our checkout time. He is a very warm and friendly guy, offering plenty of great hints and tips for getting around the City. His appartment is huge for a New York appartment, the photos don't do it justice! It was perfect for a couple with a lot of luggage! We had plenty of room. The appartment is very comfortable, very clean and has everything you need (there were even cold Beers in the fridge and some snacks)! There is a Grocery store 1 minute away (at the end of the street), and the Subway was about a 3 minute walk, so very conveniently located. If you walk a couple of blocks down 2nd street there are loads of restaurants and bars etc. Several times I walked alone (to the shops etc), and felt safe in the neighbourhood. Doe's place is also in a very secure building, so we felt safe at all times. Doe's place was also great value for money! I would highly recommend staying at Doe's home. Great appartment and friendly host. Thank you Doe, we had a lovely time in your home :)"

We stayed for 7 days and we definitely felt like being home. Sammy herself is such a wonderful person! I can not imagine a better host! She helped me out from the very first beginning of the preparation of our trip until our stay. She was available all the time to solve some ""problems"". She had a lot of adivces and tips for dining, breakfast, shopping, etc. We felt like being in good hands all over the week - even before. We would definitely recommend to book with Sammy, because it just makes your trip to NYC perfect! Thank you Sammy for all your help! :-)"

60611,East Harlem,Foi bem tranquilo ficar na casa da Blanca. Fácil acesso ao metrô e bem pertinho do Central Park. O Tedy foi bastante atencioso e sempre nos ajudou no que precisamos.
1422815,East Harlem,"The apartment was spacious and proper with all things that we needed, although it's a bit old but cozy. For the kitchen, it wasn't clean enough for me so I didn't use it (it had some smells and stains) Somehow the microwave was fine, I used it sometimes. The place is very convenient, close to subway and lots of stores (my favorite place is dollar tree, everything is just $1 :)       
I got some problems during the stay, I think Ludwig was busy so sometimes he was unreachable but he had tried to fix the problem soonest. He also was very kind to allow me to drop my luggage at the apartment until late night, that was really helpful. Thanks Ludwig!

1506985,East Harlem,"Omar era in Pakistan quindi non lo abbiamo potuto incontrare di persona. é sempre stato raggiungibile via email e (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)  per eventuali problemi e si è anche informato più volte per sapere se era tutto a posto. ha sempre risposto con sollecitudine alle richieste di consigli sui locali ed è stato disponibile ad accogliere tutte le nostre richieste per l'arrivo e la partenza. anche prima della partenza si è premurato di conoscere i nostri bisogni e di farci trovare tutto a posto. Avevamo un contatto con un suo amico in caso di necessità. l'appartamento è grande, luminoso, tutto era assolutamente pulito e funzionante. il giardino, seppur piccolo, offre un comodo spazio all'aperto. I vicini sono gentili e disponibili e ci si sente a casa. l'appartamento è a pochi minuti da central park e dalle fermate della metropolitana, quindi è comodo per scendere verso il centro su entrambi i lati di central park. ci sono parecchi locali nelle vicinanze per cui è anche comodo se si vuole mangiare in zona. I tre bagni sono infine una grande comodità. non ho usato lavatrice ed asciugatrice perché non ne ho avuto bisogno. Soggiornando da Omar ho potuto imparare ad appressare Harlem come non avevo mai fatto prima. la prossima volta che vado a NY sarà la mia prima scelta!

6234096,East Harlem,"Heather provided a great first time experience with Air BnB .
She responds quickly, and really makes the whole process so easy. Her apartment is adorable. Very nicely decorated , really safe area, around good shopping and eating spots. We were able to explore almost all of New York ,and then come back to the homey cute apartment . The experience was great ! We felt like real new yorkers lol :) 

p.s. Get ready for the walk up the stairs. I know everyone says this, but it is a walkkk ..... but the safety of the neighborhood, the cute clean apartment, the private roof top , it all makes up for it."
13733926,East Harlem,"Great place and friendly host. Stayed in NYC for 4 nights and this place was the perfect deal. If you are looking for an affordable place to sleep at nights for those who really want to experience NYC this is your place. Located a short walk to the 6 line subway, which feeds directly into lower Manhattan, and just a 5 minute walk to Central Park. The host was nice and open to any questions plus the place was clean."
1930891,East Harlem,"Elizabeth was a great host! Her check in and check out times were flexible which was great for us since we came in early in the morning. When we checked in, she met us and gave us the run down of the apartment, answered any questions that we had, and quickly got out of our hair after that. There was cable and wifi. It was a pretty quiet building (no crazy neighbors) and the neighborhood wasn't bad. Location was super convenient. Lots of food spots and the subway station was nearby (we could easily take the 6 downtown). Also some convenient stores nearby if you forgot a toothbrush or something. Overall we had a wonderful time. Elizabeth was always very easy to get a hold of by phone. Check out was a breeze. She assured us that she would take care of everything (trash and linens). Definitely recommend this listing!"
12938602,East Harlem,"Yes, the place smells like smoke. Yes, there's a dip in the bed. But the bedding was clean and the fan works if you plug it in. Cory was cool with our later than expected show time and asked several times if we needed anything before we left for the day. Worth $150? No, but for a last minute booking, it got the job done. "
12246178,East Harlem,"Jack's room is really nice and confortable. It has a good position in Manhattan, 15min walking to the nearest train to downtown."
4470011,East Harlem,"The apartment was very neat, spacious and peaceful. Hanna was easy to reach and accommodated us immediately. My favorite detail about the apartment is how bright it is during the day. I appreciated the lovely artwork as well. Subways are super close.
In regards to the neighborhood, there is a great breakfast spot on 110th street & 2nd Ave. "
600603,East Harlem,"Paul is a very nice host with a lot of helpful knowledge about the area and NY in general. He is very easy to talk to but always respects your privacy. The apartment is in a surprisingly safe environment. The bedroom is big and clean. Although the cats love to come in and take over the bed, unless you didn't close the door. I enjoyed the stay very much. If you don't need much more than a bed and a shower and you wanna save money for other things in that great city, then Paul's place should be your choice."
1082406,East Harlem,"Excellent location, very close to the metro station, close to markets and bakeries! A very nice neighborhood!

De plus, l'appartement est situé à moins de 5 minutes à pied du métro et moins de 10 minutes de Central Park. Amy a un cartable rempli de suggestions de restos dans les environs et nous en avons essayé deux qui ne nous ont pas déçu. Finalement, Amy a toujours répondu à mes messages rapidement, avant et durant mon séjour, que ce soit par courriel ou SMS. Est-ce que j'y retourne? Certainement. "
15213742,East Harlem,Did a great job hosting us.  Treated us like their very own family.  Were able to help us with any questions we had about the city.   Located in a great location filled with friendly people.  Easy access to the subway station and located right next to a shopping mall.

1074155,East Harlem,"Nancy was a faboulous host! Connected with her the moment we met. Very welcoming and open to being conversational yet gave me the peace I needed after a long 2 day flight. The apartment was quiet and cool, the bed very comfortable and the whole place was very tidy. The area is quiet also, and not too far from Central Park/Museum Mile etc. She really went the extra mile with the room, posting little notes and providing some great information on NYC which was helpful as this was my first time here. Nancy is a very intelligent woman with many unique and insightful ideas on the world around us, she is very passionate about various causes, which I found inspiring. She is a true New Yorker, very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!

12761910,Elmhurst,Great stay.
3265410,Elmhurst,"My friend and I ended up staying at two of Hector's rooms and both were very clean and spacious, and offered tons of privacy and natural lighting. The apartment itself is conveniently situated in Jackson Heights and is about a 5-7 min walk from the Roosevelt Terminal, and is also 2 blocks away from the Jackson Heights Terminal, which made going in and out of the city such a breeze. Apart from the awesome apartment, Hector is also a great host as he catered to our needs and made sure that my friend and I felt at home the entire time. We got the chance to have dinner with him on our last night and, needles to say, he's also very charming and has tons of funny and interesting stories to tell. We would definitely book his place in a heartbeat next time we're in town.

Sending you lots of love from California,
Riza & Almira"

15604507,East New York,"Kessy-Ann was our first Airbnb booking and truly made the experience in NY so much more comfortable and easy. She is helpful, sweet, attentive, accommodating and overall a very friendly person. The subway is right around the corner, literally less than 5 minutes away.

299531,East New York,Everything were according to the description. Tom was helpful and fast to respond. The area was central with different shops nearby.

1377134,East Village,"I felt very safe in Rocco's apartment. It was a nice introduction to NYC! The room was large with a pretty large bed, too. I think Rocco's shower is too good to be true! Rocco was so welcoming and didn't even think twice when I couldn't figure out how to open the door or when I accidentally woke him up! My time with him was very short, but enjoyable. Rocco is a great host in a very fun neighborhood!"
14564158,East Village,"Jon made sure that we got a proper reception and a thorough explanation of everything even though we arrived very late. The place was in perfect condition and we could simply fall into bed (or rather, get a pizza and eat it). 

This apartment was in perfect location for us, and in a great location in general. It's a great base if you'll be around the east village a lot."
6375331,East Village,"Couldn't have asked for a better location. Exactly the kind of place we were looking for as it was fuss free, with a quick and easy key collection and drop-off and we enjoyed being left to ourselves. Curtis was quick at replying to messages and the flat has wifi and Apple TV too. Great to use as a base if you don't mind living out of your suitcase (no storage). The radiator and pipes could be a little noisy at times but we are heavy sleepers so it never bothered us. Some of the reviews mention cleanliness but we found it clean and it looks exactly as listed. Would stay here again."
10608844,East Village,It was a nice stay.

We enjoyed our last night in NYC at Billy's place! Thanks "
4249131,East Village,"Great apartment, exactly as the photos show. Location is everything, walking distance to everything you could want amd a subway station for anything else nearby too.

8520094,East Village,Wonderful experience. Clean and close to everything we needed. Ed is extremely friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend a stay at his place. Side note...you might want to throw in a hair dryer in your apartment. I tend to pack lightly for these trips. 
277370,East Village,Jim's apartment was perfect for our trip. It was just the right size for my wife and I for our 6 day visit to the city. The apartment had everything we needed. The kitchen was great and meant we got to eat fresh meals when we wanted to (although I lost count of the number of quality takeaway restaurants within walking distance!). It couldn't have been easier to get around the city with the subway at Union Square being a short walk away. Jim made the trip really easy for us. He was great at emailing out information about our arrival and the pack he put together (and labels!) made it a pretty foolproof visit. We'll be sure to try to stay here again if we get the opportunity to come back to NYC. We'd thoroughly recommend Jim's apartment to anyone wanting to visit the city. It will make your trip amazing!
4662109,East Village,"L'appartement est très bien situé, dans un quartier très agréable avec plein de restaurants et de boutiques. La salle de bain et la kitchenette mériteraient un bon rafraîchissement. 
Le rendez vous s'est bien passé à l'arrivée et des informations touristiques nous attendaient. super séjour! Merci"
1124012,East Village,"The apartment is very nice, in an area plenty of restaurants and pubs. The flat is small but cozy and correctly presented in the pictures on the website. It is in the heart of the East Village, but we often walked to the West Village or Soho without even taking the subway. However, it is few minutes by walk from several subway lines.
We had no problems in finding the building and Meredith managed to be at home when we arrived in the city. She’s a lovely person and she’s always been very helpful with her suggestions. 
In the apartment lives also Sky, Zac’s dog. Sky is really quiet and never barks and you can easily become her friend: few pampering and she is yours!
In conclusion, it has been a very good experience. The flat is well located and Meredith is really kind and friendly.

20299,East Village,"Edward is a very nice host and can tell you a lot about NY. I really enjoyed my stay at his place; it is very conveniently located, very authentic and you're in the middle of things and still it is quiet and you get a good night's sleep. The room you get is not big or fancy, but has a big bed, TV,  chair, chest of drawers and a place to hang some clothes. It is wall-to-wall with the kitchen (you see the door to the room on the pictures) but not noisy. His apartment is basic, a little used, and not big (so just as he describes it), but it is clean and everything works etc.
I can recommend a stay at his place!"

2079253,East Village,"It is just great to stay in Adrianas Studio. Quiet, cosy and so central in the middle of East Village. Bowery, Mott St, Union Square reachable within 15-25 minutes. Cafe Mogador, St. Marks Place, Cafe Odin, St. Marks Place and Mud where my favourite breakfast places. For a very special event I went to Striphouse, 11, East 12th. Buses and Sub just arround the corner. Adriana is a very kind and helpful person. I was late with my arrival and she was waiting to hand me personally the key, even she had to go urgently back to work. Sorrowly of lack of time I couldn't go out with Adriana into the Verboten, Brooklyn ...
Adriana, I will come back and looking forward seeing you. Thank you so much and all the best to you xxx"
180822,East Village,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Tiffany’s apartment for 7 nights whilst on holiday in New York and absolutely loved it. The location is perfect with a multitude of bars, restaurants and shops nearby, and a beautiful park on the doorstep. It’s also close to subway stations so we found it really easy to travel around the city. It was a perfect size for the two of us and had everything we needed, we didn’t use the kitchen as the area is full of fantastic restaurants and cafes, it would seem a waste to eat at home! Tiffany was always quick to respond to any messages we sent while staying there and picking up and dropping off the keys was seamless. She allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment after check out time which was great as we had a late flight. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a home from home in the city."

Tons of great food very close including Katzs deli. There is even a comedy shop a few blocks away that has awesome shows. The Internet was solid too. Definitely recommend this place. He even had a packet ready on how to use the TV which was enormous. Very comfortable bed.

L'appartamento era pulito e la descrizione corrisponde esattamente a  quello che abbiamo trovato. Abbiamo viaggiato con le nostre 2 bambine e gli spazi dell'appartamento sono stati perfetti.
L'appartamento si trova al primo piano e le stanze da letto si affacciano sulla strada...a volte sono un po' rumorose.
Il quartiere non è male.
Viaggiando con 2 bimbe piccole abbiamo trovato abbastanza lontano l'accesso alla metropolitana, che comunque si raggiunge (a passo da adulto) in 15 minuti. Grazie Jimmy!"
436619,East Village,"I had a really great time staying with Carla and would be really happy to stay there again if I were coming back to New York at any stage. She was extremely friendly & accommodating as well as humorous & interesting to talk to & I felt very much at ease in her place. The apartment & bedroom are as described, bright & comfortable. The neighbourhood itself is one of the most interesting in New York, full of character & close to the Lower East Side & Soho. Lots of other great places are within easy walking distance & the subway is also close so it's an ideal spot for exploring Manhattan."

13344411,East Village,"Gabe gave me a lot of great information before arriving, and was very helpful. Easy check-in and check-out. The apt. was perfect and in a great location. There were lots of wonderful restaurants, cafes, and shops nearby. It's located on a quieter street, so noise was not an issue. Most importantly though, is it had the most comfortable bed ever! I would highly recommend staying here. "

60680,East Village,"We totally enjoyed our stay in Mich's apartment. She was very helpful and responded our questions quickly. The appartment   is perfect for three persons. The actual appartment looks exactely like on the pictures. However, the air conditioner wasn't installed anymore in the bedroom but we just opened the window, so it wasn't an issue at all. Also, Mich provided us sheets and towels for our stay.

The East Village is a modern and really nice part of Manhattan with many bars and restaurants. Especially on the weekend the streets are crowed with people. However, we felt always safe walking through the streets even when it was late. Furthermore, we recommend Tompkins square bagels for breakfast.  

This was our first airbnb experience but definitely not our last one. We totaly recommend Mich's apartment for a great holiday trip in New York City!"
3075573,East Village,"Tiffany is a great host. Even though we did not meet her in person, she timely replied all of my questions by emails/texts before/during our stay. The apartment is at an Excellent location with a lot of good restaurants and 3 subway stations nearby. "

2433604,East Village,"Diana and Lemon worked hard to make sure that the pre-visit communication, our arrival, our stay, and our departure worked perfectly.  They're great hosts who respond quickly to any question.  We found them to be very generous in proactively offering to waive cancellation fees and, when we decided to stay despite the construction they unilaterally compensated us for scaffolding that covered the building during our stay and construction noise.  They're super-nice people.  Its just unfortunate that due to their busy schedules we were not able to have more face-to-face interaction with them.  The stay was perfect.  The location is amazing if you want to experience a real Manhattan neighborhood.  We're so glad we selected this quiet retreat."
5562710,East Village,"Had a great time! The apartment was clean, quiet and bright. We were happy to have our apartment for the weekend instead of a hotel! Check in and check out was super easy. "
16737,East Village,"Viaje con una amiga a ny por 10 dias y paramos en lo de Sinan, fue una muy buena experiencia, una habitacion para nosotras con baño privado y entrada directa. Todo muy limpio y comodo. La hubicacion es muy buena, el subte esta a 8 cuadras. Sinan es muy atento, se quemo una de las luces de la habitacion, le avisamos, y ese mismo dia ya lo habia  arreglado. El colchon es un sillon cama, yo dormi bien pero mi amiga se quejaba un poco de los resortes. Tuvimos una muy buena experiencia, lo volveriamos a elegir, sin duda lo recomiendo."
144855,East Village,"Staying at Sasha's studio was wonderful. The place, although quite small, offered enough space for two people. The apartment was very  clean and comfortable. Sasha communicated with me promptly over the phone, and allowed me to stay a few hours beyond the check-out time. The studio was equipped with AC that was a blessing in the middle of the summer. I highly recommend staying at Sasha's studio. It was a perfect base for exploring Manhattan."

The key drop off has been easy and Vivienne was available for any questions during and responded immediately. 
Unfortunately their is a construction at the moment underneath the apartment and on weekdays they start early. But as we were here for feeling the city and getting the vibe of NYC it didn't bothered us much to get up early. 
The place is higly recommended for 4 people who want a good apartment in a nice area. "
12275253,Jamaica Estates,She's awesome  
3157747,Financial District,"First of all, Gotham is my city.  I was born in New York City, and have spent almost my entire life here.  If you are looking to experience the really downtown, really New York, really creative and artist loft life style, Michaela's apartment is it.  And if you are just looking for a really nice place to stay, this is it too.  I spent a month here in between selling and buying apartments.

One minute you're outside and it is the dirty, crowded and noisy city, walk up two flights, and you're in an Oasis.  Michaela's apartment is stylishly furnished and elegant.  The kitchen and appliances are all modern and higher end, there's even a clothes washer and dryer.  She's got a nice collection of pots and pans if you want to cook, and plates and silverware.  The apartment is immaculately clean, the bed and couch are comfortable and there's wifi and cable.  

In the area, A La Saigon is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant for takeout, Majestic Pizza – REAL New York Pizza – is located across the street next to the legendary Century 21 Department Store, and Zaitzeff has a cult following for its burgers and hand cut fries.  You're steps away from the World Trade Center, Wall Street and South Street Seaport.  Fulton Street Station can be entered at the corner, with access to 11 subway lines.

I didn't have much occasion to contact Michaela, but when I did she responded quickly despite being far away.  She seems to be a really nice person."
10986065,Financial District,"Michael was a gracious host, responsive and accommodating to my last minute booking. And being in FiDi is incredibly convenient. Anywhere you could want to go in the city is a short walk to every subway line. Close to the Battery, South Street, waterfront, Brookfield, the list of attractions in walking distance is endless. It truly is THE up and coming neighborhood in the city."
9490137,Financial District,Nice place for a large group! Clean and lots of light. Mark was nice to meet us earlier than check in so that we could drop off our luggage and explore. Very close to the East river so was nice.
10102011,Financial District,"Jessica is very very nice! We have to ask for extra hours both before and after we stay. She is generously to help us with our special situation! The place is very clean and as beautiful as posted. Location is very close to lower Manhattan visiting places. Definitely recommend for friends. Thank you so much, Jessica!"
8012976,Financial District,"Donna was an amazing host. She was really kind and always looking forward to what we needed. The apartment is much nicer than what is seen on the pictures. The room and the private bathroom are big and confortable. The view from the room and living room is really nice. You even have access to the roof with places to sit and enjoy the spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge and South Manhattan. The location of the building is perfect, at just a couple of blocks from many metro lines and the One World Trade Center. "
3933559,Financial District,Sasha's flat was fantastic! The entire place was squeaky clean and family friendly. Perfect location next to Staten Island Ferry and The Dead Rabbit (awesome bar). Would certainly come back.

4624874,Flatbush,"Terrance helped us out every time we needed something sorted out in the room, and even provided us with bottled water, snacks, and coffee upon checking-in. He was very respectful of our privacy, and communicated with us graciously. The location is good as it is near a subway station (B/Q trains). The neighborhood is relatively quiet, and we were never bothered by what's going on outside the apartment."
2305890,Flatbush,"Jake was a fantastic host!
He was extremely kind and full of attentions for me and my doughter.
He even bought a hair-dryer when I asked him if he had one!
The house was clean and confortable, 10 min walking to the subway stations.
Hope to see Jake again, I really suggest his apartment."
302057,Flatbush,"Alice and Stan were wonderful hosts from start to finish, and I would be very happy to stay with them again. They were extremely accommodating with my arrival, and provided very nice amenities in the room. The room is quite large and very cheerful, and has a good table by the window for working. The neighborhood is extremely walkable, and I used both of the subway stops which are nearby. 

Both Alice and Stan were a lot of fun to chat with, and have a great deal of local knowledge and history, as well as just being all around interesting people. I would recommend them highly. "
329064,Flatbush,"Wonderful house, very spacious, and Marc and his family were super friendly and helpful! "

11784648,Flatbush,Ricke gave my fiancée & I to feel a home away from home. We were very close Downtown Brooklyn & Manhattan. He was always promot with his responses & considerate of what we needed. We enjoyed our stay. We recommend this the place to be if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn.
6146783,Flatbush,"Sandra and Cary are amazing hosts, charming and welcoming, I felt at ease during my stay. The accommodation matched the pic exactly! The neighborhood is very quiet at the same time offering easy access to mass transit and a variety of shops. The home is beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC"
7181242,Flatbush,Just the fact that Incould check in at 4.00 AM outside of the normal declzred time is great! Many thanks to Aaron for that flexibility. The AC and fan were on full speed allowing for fresh room in the heat of NYC In mid-August. Free wifi was a great surprise and worked perfectly. This place is cheap to NY standards I assume and fills the purpose perfectly for in-between flights short stay. Am totally green to Air BnB so cannot compare but I'd stay there again in similar circumstances.
6239643,Flatbush,"Marilyn's place was very nice. The room is small, but the bed is comfortable and Marilyn is friendly and welcoming. The apartment is also very close to the Q. Highly recommended! Would definitely stay again."
925219,Flatbush,"Rick is a great host! During our two night stay he was always very friendly and helpful. He was easy to connect with and was quick with pre-arrival communication about the details of our trip. His apartment offers a cozy atmosphere, is in a great location, and has a conveniently placed subway right outside his building. He was very informative about how to get to places in the city via subway. Rick was even willing to lend us two metro cards that he had at the time. Great guy, great place.. would definitely recommend his place to anyone looking to visit NYC. "
5406187,Flatbush,"Murat was a great host and a very nice person. He is cultured, educated and personable. The apartment was clean and quiet, and there are two subway stations within easy walking distance
There were two subway stops within walking distance.

The neighborhood was a bit on the 'iffy' side. I was comfortable walking there at night but I think a single woman might feel a bit uncomfortable."
1530561,Flatiron District,"Celestes place was beautiful ! The location was great and it was everything and more. We will definitely stay again.
"
450393,Flatiron District,"The apartment was pretty accurately described.  It is well located, near grocery store, subway etc... The apartment was clean. It served our purposes just fine. Esther was responsive when she could be, but seemed to be out of the country and unreachable for long periods while we were there.  I did have her sister's number that I could have called if I was really desperate.  When we arrived the heat wasn't working properly and it was a very cold January.  The batteries in the thermostat were dead.  The next day we went and bought new ones. The units only worked sporadically though even after that.  There were three units and usually at least one was working so it wasn't so bad.  Esther said she was going to address the issue after we left. Overall, I would recommend the apartment.  "
13417688,Flatiron District,"My in-laws were impressed with the beauty and cleanliness of the appartment. The location is a great home base to discover New York, and Gramercy Park is a very safe and nice neighbourhood.
Abe was extremely responsive to messages and questions, and made sure everything was there to make it a wonderful first AirBnB experience for my in-laws."
682122,Flatlands,"My friends and I loved to stay at Yolanda's! We were super welcomed, we arrived late in the night,  and we were received with a fridge with bread, butter, wine, coke, summarizing,  few snacks there. The house was clean, the beds were confortable.Also, there is a binder with information about the city. Another great point is about the transportation, besides being away from downtown,  there are buses and metros all the time. Thanks Yolanda,  we had a great time at your place! "

5895082,Flushing,"Anna was a great host and made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. She called me the next morning to see how things were going with the room and was able to respond positively to my request. The room was large, the bed comfortable, and it was clean and neat. I felt safe traveling in the neighborhood at night as I found myself coming back to the Airbnb in the late evening from my exploits in Manhattan. The buses ran frequently enough to transfer to the # 7 subway. I'm glad there was a refrigerator available as well as microwave. All in all a very good experience. "
1107432,Flushing,"Great stay! Kind host, clean place, and good location. Highly recommend. "
886833,Flushing,"Christina's house was perfect to stay in New York. The room was clean and comfortable.

546383,Flushing,"Me and my husband stayed for one night in Linda's house, and nothing could be better!  This was a last moment reservation, but Linda is so fast!
The room is bright and clean, there is everithing you need  there, even some cosmetics and razors. And Linda is an ideal host - so welcoming, easy going, cheerful and helpful (we got great help with parking the car, packing our bicycles and all needed information). Actually we were  treated not as just guests, but as friends.
The area is very interesting, a small walk led us to Chinese district with lots of shops, diners and pastries.
We really enjoyed staying in this hospitable house! The only thing I regret that we couldn't stay longer, that was the last day of our trip. I highly recommend Linda's guest room, you will like this place and comfy atmosphere!"
2559090,Gowanus,"Sean's place was clean, comfortable and convenient to several subway stations, restaurants and other amenities. He was also a great host. Thanks Sean!"
912721,Gowanus,"Zachary and Jody's apartment was just perfect for us and we loved everything about it. Having an outdoor area with a BBQ was a bonus and we really enjoyed being able to sit outside and enjoy the summer weather. It is an open space which is appropriately sectioned by tasteful furnishings. Zachary is a most welcoming host and our late night arrival did not cause a problem. He was very approachable and contactable but although he lives upstairs he did not encroach on our privacy. After traveling for 4 weeks it was great to have the space to unpack and settle in. The kitchen is well appointed and Zachary seems to have thought of everything.  There are guide books to enjoy and suggestions for neighborhood cafes, restaurants and markets. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this apartment, especially if you are wanting enjoy the Brooklyn neighborhood. "
493611,Gowanus,Ute was a great host and very accommodating to my specific needs! Thank you!

Great neighborhood that was very walkable and easy to find parking in; super clean apartment that looks just like the photos; there was even a six pack of beers awaiting us! 
Max was very easy to get in touch with and we would definitely stay again. "
9645934,Forest Hills,"We had a wonderful stay at Beto's BNB in Forrest Hills, Queens. The area is well connected to the city through various subway stations. It is a peaceful and secure neighborhood and there are several good restaurants nearby. The apartment was clean and the building was easily accessible. Beto was extremely kind and helpful - he let us use the kitchen and supplies. It was an overall great experience and we highly recommend this BNB to couples looking for a calm vacation. "
4120182,Forest Hills,"It was a good experience staying in Ms. Ling's. The neighbor is quiet and safe. The room is very spacious and clean, and guests would also get the second-floor living room, kitchen and bathroom. I had little interaction with the hosts who are living downstairs, and there were a lot of restricting signs that made me feel a little bit unwelcome. Those were not big deals though. The only thing for me was that the house was like 15 mins' walk from the forest hills subway stop, and almost 40 mins' ride to Manhattan, which might be not convenient for a traveler. But overall, I liked the place. "
44229,Fort Greene,"Lovely room with a large, comfortable bed and a spacious spa-like bathroom. Great location for us on a quiet neighborhood street just a few blocks from restaurants."

82525,Fort Greene,"The apartment is a timeless gem featuring original architecture coupled with modern furnishings. It has a huge kitchen (rare for ny) and a nice big bath tub with plenty of hot water. Nan and Gerard are great hosts and personify everything you would hope from this cultural meca. They are artistic, foodie, world travelers with warm hearts. I would recommend this place to everyone."
1933687,Fort Greene,"Brandon made every effort to answer my questions prior to our arrival.  The space was exactly as represented in the photo. The neighborhood was a pleasant, clean, residential area. There was a school directly across the street.  During the day, it was warming to hear the children play.  Brandon was a fine host and made us feel welcome.   While not intrusive, he did make sure we knew he was available should any need arise.  I would recommend this location for its cleanliness and proximity to Pratt Institute."
18590,Fort Greene,"My girlfriend and I spent 5 days at Blaise's place. Blaise was really helpful and reachable all the time. The house is amazing, we felt really confortable and we were able to rest perfectly. The subway is 10-15 minutes away and have good connections with Manhattan. The neighborhood is safe and with many services around. It was an incredible experience, one that we recommend."
231194,Fort Greene,"Wij hebben met 5 personen vier nachten gebruik gemaakt van de woning van Lori. Het was precies zoals beschreven, 2 slaapkamers met prima bedden en een slaapbank, deze lag zacht, maar door het matras op de grond te leggen was heT probleem opgelost. De winkels en ook de metro was op loopafstand, met de metro kun je erg gemakkelijk naar alle bekende plekken in Manhatten, ook was JFK makkelijk bereikbaar. Wij zijn erg tevreden en kunnen deze ruimte zeker aanbevelen. We zaten er in juli 2015, de airco hield de ruimtes koel."
7775879,Fort Greene,Danuza was excellent. The place was clean and tidy. The instructions were clear. Danuza was very quick to reply to my questions.  The location was not too far from the subway and easy to access from Manhattan. We were very comfortable!
10209471,Fort Greene,"Liane was lovely and her home was so beautiful! The room was huge, very well decorated and had a comfy bed. The location was perfect - walkable to so many great spots in Brooklyn and easy to get to Manhattan. I would highly recommend staying here!"
3456576,Fort Greene,"Michelle was a great host. She was accommodating and responsive and knew a lot about the area. The place itself was very nice and clean as well with plenty of closet space. Although we didn't make use of the kitchen, it was fully stocked with plates, bowls, and utensils if we needed them. The place is also very close to the train station which made it very convenient to get anywhere. "
12422277,Fort Greene,"Shawn was a great host. He made sure before hand that someone would be there to greet us when we arrived. His girlfriend was very friendly and helpful when she greeted us at the apartment to hand off the keys. The place was as expected - very roomy, and had a great aesthetic. The location was perfect. Right next to the subway for easy access to different parts of the city. The area was awesome and had a lot of great spots to eat, drink and hang out. Would definitely recommend Shawn's place for a great stay in Brooklyn."
857216,Fort Greene,Adam was incredibly helpful and flexible with our accommodation - I would definitely rent from him again!  Great communication.  Thanks so much!
45556,Fort Greene,"A very small, cozy, quiet bedroom good for one traveler, or two travelers who don't mind sharing a bed ha ha. In an apparent converted private library that continues to serve as such, so there's lots of interesting books too!

Host was very welcoming and had simple and reasonable rules. I traveled alone and took some phone calls from the room, and this was fine with everyone.

Location is a short walk to Brooklyn's Metrotech Center, where I was attending a conference, and that worked out great. Lots of coffee shops and bars and restaurants and such in walking distance, and lots of subway stations too. Getting to / from Penn Station from here is trivial.

Thanks Doug!"
263005,Fort Greene,"Marisa was the best host. She communicated often, had a fabulous place to rent & prepared a detailed synopsis of the neighborhood, things to do, transportation options etc. the furnishings made one feel right at home. Having the back patio was an added plus. Also, the a/c in the bedroom was a life safer as it was hot during our stay."
1205103,Fort Greene,"""Cozy & Private"" don't even begin to describe this adorable little gem of a cottage. Surrounded by a vibrant neighborhood, finding this secluded oasis was like stumbling into someone's secret garden. Everything was immaculate, the setting was soothing and tranquil, and yet you are just a cobblestone pathway from the pulsating bustle of Brooklyn. Sarah and Allon were perfect hosts, and provided any and everything necessary to feel at home here. I was able to visit with my children, eat at amazing restaurants, and then relax in this quiet retreat; the cottage was even better than I expected. Check in couldn't have been easier. The bathroom is pristine, and the space was a ""complete home"", not just a ""bedroom"". I've stayed in numerous places in Manhattan and Brooklyn ( mostly hotels) over the years - this was by far one of my best experiences. I would recommend a stay with Sarah and Allon to anyone, and will be back!"
10963433,Fresh Meadows,I will definitely recommend this place
7772479,Gramercy,"Aaron & Paz´s apartment was great, confortable, clean and perfect for a couple. It´ was in a very good location in Manhattan, and let us to visit the hole the city in an easy way. The bed was perfect and the kitchen allowed us to have breakfast and dinner there, so it was helpful saving money. Paz was very kind with us, receiving us the arrival day and explaining us where to go out for dinner or pubs for a drink, all of them near of the apartment. Moreover, she spoke with us in our language (Spanish) and she greeted us with some fruits. We would definitely recommend this place. It´s the best opcion if you want to enjoy as a new yorker. Be sure that, if we can, we will repeat the place. "
1900780,Gramercy,Would definitely stay here again! Wish this gem of a place was my own. 
11621452,Gramercy,"Great stay at Rehan's place! Easy to find, clean, great location. Very responsive host, I recommend!"
1876811,Gramercy,"Communicating with Dan was fantastic.  He responded to all questions and concerns quickly and effectively.  Furthermore, he was proactive in asking if we needed any assistance.  However, little additional help was needed since the apartment was as described, functioned well and came with very detailed written instructions on how to use everything.  The apartment itself is clean, comfortable and in a wonderful neighbhorhood with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby but also nice and quiet during the wee hours.  Overall, a fantastic experience for 1 person or a couple."
13417080,Gramercy,"Don't go there, there are bed bugs!

La chambre est fidèle aux images, elle est pratique pour un court sejour (nous avons passé trois nuits) mais je vous conseille de choisir un autre endroit pour une longue durée. Les lits sont plutot inconfortables... Il y a un fer à repasser, et de l'air conditionnée, bien pratique lorsqu'il fait chaud! Un petit frigot serait pratique pour ranger des bouteilles d'eau :) Par ailleurs, la connexion WIFI est mauvaise, elle ne marche que dans le couloir et dans la salle de bain ce qui est un peu embêtant quand il faut s'assoir par terre...

La propreté est correcte mais pas parfaite (salle de bain)... La chambre est faite tous les jours. En revanche, il y a des punaises de lit!!! (Comme apparement beaucoup d'endroits à New York...) Si vous êtes allergiques ou craignez d'en ramener avec vous, je ne vous recommande pas de reserver cette chambre!!!

Par contre, elle est très bien située, à 30 minutes à pieds de Times square environ. Il y a des fastfood qui ferment à 10 ou 11 heure le soir, Barnes&Noble a deux pas, un Starbucks au bout de la rue, des magasins tels que Forever21, Kiehl's... Bref, l'emplacement est super. Bon, par contre, la nuit c'est un peu brouillant (c'est New York City!) et la clim masque le son de la musique du bar donc c'est bien. 

En résumé, c'est une chambre pratique mais si je ne la réserverai pas à nouveau à cause des souvenirs que j'ai rapporté avec moi...

12711875,Gramercy,"Good communication, convenient location and fair price made this the perfect place for our trip to NY. Thanks!"
15857407,Gramercy,"Apartamento nuevo, muy acogedor, en una zona muy tranquila y muy cerca del metro.
Nos encontramos el apartamento muy limpio, los electrodomésticos muy nuevos, la cocina bien equipada y con básicos ya incluidos  (había café, aceite, sal,...). La lavadora y la secadora funcionaban bien y había jabón extra en todos los lavabos.
Nosotros éramos 5 adultos, 1 niño y 2 bebés y el apartamento fue perfecto para nuestra estancia.
Necesitamos una cuna y David nos la proporcionó previo pago claro, pero se ocupó de todo con amabilidad.
Si tuviese que repetir, volvería seguro."
8873479,Gramercy,"Darin and her apartment were fantastic. Perfect for my needs while in NYC. The room was spacious and tidy – possibly more spacious than the pictures indicate. Although Darin was staying at her apartment at the time, it really didn't feel like I was intruding on someone's home as the room had its own bathroom. Also, access to the room did not require going through Darin's personal space. Arrangements and communications were very easy and I'd definitely stay here again... as well as recommend it to others. "
9713493,Gramercy,"We are very happy from our stay @Matthew's house. We are 4 people (incl. 2 kidz 8yo & 10yo) and he remind us that the Appt. may be tight prior the booking. We've decided to move fwd anyway and it was perfect. So Matt is honest, and a very friendly person. He was waiting for us at the appt, provided guidance and advices to enjoy as much as possible HIS town. We've spent half a day with him and we truly enjoyed this friendship relationship & unbelievable & secret places we discovered together. Regarding the appt, it's a very quiet place, very well located and efficient. Definitely this experience was a big part of our trip enjoyment!"
3825743,Gramercy,Ariel was very thorough through out our entire stay at her wonderful apartment. We were informed of all necessary information before and during our stay in NY. Apartment was lovely and location was amazing. Amazing stay and loved Ariel to bits. 
6887755,Gravesend,If you're looking for a great place to stay this is perfect. It is very close to Coney Island and minutes walk to the F train. Easy access to the city. The host was awesome and was very easy to get in contact with. He by far has the best check in and check out process. The Unit was very clean and spacious. Would stay here again.
1260031,Kensington,"I had a wonderful stay here and wouldn't hesitate to come again. This is a private attic space embedded in a warm and friendly home. The Kensington neighborhood is interesting and ethnically diverse, catering to the people who live and work there. Everything is convenient on foot-- from drug stores to restaurants, yet there is parking on the streets. Great!"
2078796,Kensington,"Very happy with this place and Phil!  He was accommodating to our messy schedule which was great.  Place was quiet, clean, and a short walk to cortelyou rd station to get on subway.  Highly recommend.  "
679800,Kensington,"Vava was a very gracious hostess. This was a second-time stay with her and it was as good as the first.  She welcomes you into her home and then lets  you come and go as you please.  She sets out a generous breakfast; the orange juice and bananas were our favorites.  The Church Ave. neighborhood provided us with Faro's for lunch, Korner Pizza for supper, and the Church Bar for a friendly drink; also subway with the F line.  We would recommend Vava and her Brooklyn location.  "

44619,Greenpoint,"My brother and I really enjoyed our time at Lawrence's place. He prepared a very useful info package which made it easy for us to find the loft. The neighbourhood is great, with nice cafés and restaurants. It is also quite easy to get to Manhattan. We loved having breakfast on the rooftop, the view is indeed breathtaking! "
4137979,Greenpoint,"+ : 
Safe and quiet neighborhood with many interestng shops and restaurants

Nicely and fully eqipped room including water, juice, coffee

Host(Eric) was very helpful and attentive! :)

- : 
Tight street parking at nights...I assume that street parking is not easy anywhere in NYC at nights when ppl finish their work and return home..."
685364,Greenpoint,"This is a great place in Greenpoint!  Well located, clean and really really spacious.  We were 5 girls and never felt like we were in each other's way.  The 2 full bathrooms made it much easier for us to get ready and the apt was well equipped with iron, ironing board, hair dryer, washer/dryer, and dishwasher.  All nice features for groups.  No issues at all with check in or communication.  

P.S. Charlotte's Cafe down the street had the best muffins I have ever tasted! "
1185060,Greenpoint,"Although my flight landed earlier than the check-in time, David was accommodating and provided clear directions to get to the location. And once you reach the roof, the views are spectacular! It's fairly close to the metro which makes going to Williamsburg, DUMBO, or Manhattan, a breeze. I saw David from time to time, and he was always cordial.

Since this was summer, my sleeping area was actually quite hot, so protip: turn on the fan as soon you get there and let the air circulate. Also, to slow yourself going down the slide, simply lean forward and put more pressure on your foot. 

There are actually 4 other sleeping quarters, one of which is for David. I didn't mind since I was out most of the day. But I didn't really have a place to put my stuff so it ended up sprawling at the end of the slide. Also, since there is only 1 restroom for potentially 7 guests, it could be a  challenge sometimes (I didn't mind it either).

The place is neat, spacious, and in a great location. If you plan on seeing the city most of the day, you can't go wrong with this loft. Plus, it's way more interesting than a hotel, and cost way less. I would say this loft probably isn't right for someone who is high-maintenance. "
12791028,Greenpoint,"We met Mona on our first day of our arrival she was friendly and a  bit in a rush, but made sure we got in on time and made sure we have all the necessary amenities.  The place is very clean, close to local mom and pop shops, and above all just a few steps away from the subway.  The neighborhood seems safe and very convenient  access to the subway, stores, restaurants, and shops.  We actually missed our flight and had to stay an extra day, and Mona was nice enough to accommodate us for another day.  Overall, our stay was great.  The only recommendation i would say is to provide at least a flat screen TV.  It would be nice to come home to relax and just watch movies after along day of sightseeing. 

Thanks Mona!"
71534,Greenpoint,"Theresa's apartment was ultra cosy and lovely - we felt right at home! The view is something to experience from the apartment - amazing! It was a smooth payment transaction as well as pick up location for the keys! Would highly recommend this apartment, especially anyone travelling from overseas! We will return 100% any day of the week! Thank you Theresa! "
173151,Greenpoint,"My host Jane was very friendly and welcoming. The studio is in a basement but still cozy and warm. The studio is close to great places in the neighborhood. I loved that I had a french bakery, a bookstore, and a ferry stop very close to the studio. I certainly will come back."
71384,Greenpoint,"Just got back... and wanna go back! We had a wonderful - although too short - stay in this loft. The space was big, well appointed, perfectly located & super quiet. I love Willamsburg and it was only a 10 minute walk there... 

We had no trouble retrieving the keys (even though we got there at midnight). Our hosts left us clear instruction for everything, 10/10 communication and that made us feel welcome. The kitties were adorable and would wake us up in the morning to remind us to feed them. They will be missed :(

Our only issue? Street parking.      "
15177338,Greenpoint,Ich habe in Janas Wohnung in Greenpoint zwei wunderbare Wochen verbracht. Jana war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und hat mich persönlich in der geschmackvoll eingerichteten Wohnung willkommen geheissen. Die Lage in Greenpoint ist fantastisch um Brooklyn und Manhattan zu entdecken.  Coole Restaurants und Bars befinden sich gleich ums Eck.  
3066976,Greenpoint,She made us feel welcome in her home. Introduced us to her cat. Was available for any questions. 
3473778,Greenpoint,The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

9342332,Greenpoint,"Bari's flat has plenty going for it. It is very spacious, is very nicely decorated and includes a garden space outside.

The flat is in a prime location: plenty of restaurants, pubs and cafes around as well as supermarkets and deli shops. The G train is a mere 5 minutes away, as are buses and the East River Ferry, which takes you all the way down to Brooklin Heights. 

We unfortunately did not get to meet Bari in person but she was very responsive whenever we contacted her, and helped us where needed. "
10049335,Greenpoint,"I rented out Melissa's place for a few days for my brother and his girlfriend over winter break. Her place was right near mine, so it was easy to have them nearby. We rented last minute, so Melissa didn't have time to change the sheets or clean the room. She was responsive about it and helped to get a cleaner in as soon as possible. Otherwise, the place was cute and easy to get to. Just as described."
6500587,Greenpoint,"Clean kitchen, clean bathroom, clean bedroom. He told me where to visit for sightseeing, restaurant, and so on. He is an excellent companion, an artist, knows many things and has good sense of humor."
727547,Greenpoint,"Our Box House Hotel experience was AWESOME. It was extremely clean and always well kept by staff. The Staff are very helpful and provide great service. It's not too far from Greenpoint Avenue Subway (G Line). It was a quiet, pleasant and convenient area - Great Cafes and Restaurants near by. Great decor, fresh look, feel and very unique. Loved all 11 nights stayed there. 

Thank you so much! Terrific stay. 10/10"
14824162,Greenpoint,Loved the neighborhood and all that was done to the house to make my group and I feel comfortable. The host provided extra towels and sheets which was very nice

557487,Greenpoint,The most I like was the cute & cool room and the outside environment in Greenpoint! It's really nice. Also practical info in PDF was useful and efficient. 
4481295,Greenpoint,The apartment was clean and very well supplied. It was in an amazing location just blocks away from all the shops and restaurants in Bedford. also very close to a giant park that had a farmers market on the weekend.
10819587,Greenwich Village,Incredible accommodations in the Village.  Rear patio is great place to hang out (unfortunately we stayed here in January.)
395613,Greenwich Village,"If you have ever wanted to live like a local in New York, this has to be one of the BEST places to base yourself.  Close to everything you could possibly want - supermarkets, subway, parks, restaurants are all virtually on your doorstep yet there is still peace and quiet (which I understand is a rarity for New York apartments).  If you are a fellow coffee-snob, you will be pleased to note that there are 4-5 fantastic cafes within a 10 minute walking radius.  

Extremely clean, well furnished, and comfortable.  The communication from Donna was faultless - totally accommodating and made everything a breeze.  Greenwich Village is a fantastic little pocket of New York - I have total envy and did not want to leave.  When I am back in this part of the world, I will be actively seeking this apartment for my stay."
271954,Greenwich Village,"Pros: The location is perfect and a beautiful street in NYC (West Village area). The apartment itself is quiet (amazing for the city) and was cool even in the summer heat. Bed was comfortable and was a cozy, easy stay! AJ accommodated our early check-in request which was fantastic and much appreciated!!

Cons: I'd say this place is best if you're traveling with someone you share a bed with (I was not), as there is only one bed. Otherwise someone gets the couch. The couch is not the sectional in the photos, but a slightly smaller couch and a chair. Something to consider if someone is sleeping on it. The stairs to the loft bed were steep, but easy if you don't have any challenges with stairs. AJ's communication before the stay was minimal and had me concerned as I hadn't heard from him. He was great once I arrived and was helpful checking in on us. 

I would definitely stay here again. Only cons were small and were easily fixed. I recommend this apartment. "

250801,Greenwich Village,"Simply an amazing place and Rhona was an amazing host!! She was extremely responsive both via text and over the phone when we called for immediate help. The apt was wonderful and exactly as advertised. The outdoor space exceeded expectations and was a welcome retreat. The neighborhood was great as well, very lively and vibrant, the best part being that the apt was still extremely quiet. Would recommend highly to anyone looking to stay in NYC. "
2356082,Greenwich Village,"Laurence hat uns rechtzeitig und zuverlässig alle Informationen gegeben, damit wir in das Appartment kommen, da wir uns leider nicht persönlich treffen konnten. Die kleine Wohnung war sauber, schön eingerichtet und mit allem ausgestattet, was man für einen Aufenthalt braucht. Wir haben uns dort wohl gefühlt. Unsere Fragen wurden sofort beantwortet. Die Lage des Appartments in Greenwich ist sehr ideal, man kann zu Fuß nach Lower Manhattan und Midtown kommen, die Metro ist nahe und im Viertel tobt das Leben mit zahllosen Kneipen und Restaurants, der Broadway mit Shopingmeile ist auch nicht weit. Trotzdem war es im Appartement nicht laut. Dieses Appartment ist zu empfehlen!"
1944087,Greenwich Village,"I stayed in Andrew apartment for 11 nights, the apartment is really nice and quite (the most importent thing for me), i also really like the neighborhood a lot of restaurants with diffrent price range and many pubs, so for sure you are not going to be hungry or bored for your stay here.
I came speicely for a seminar at NYU so it's really close for me, also i really like the Washington squre park that was few meters from the apartment.
 easy acess from JFK -just take the A line, the subway station is really close.
Also the apartment is in a walking distance to anywere.
The communication with Andrew was smooth and fast.
So in conclusion: i recommend Andrew apartment, stop your search, i am sure that you going to like the Apartment and the area as i am."
2565071,Greenwich Village,"Don was a great host.  The apartment was clean and cozy and in a fantastic location.

4854870,Greenwich Village,Chreighton was awesome! My two friends and I had a fabulous stay. His apartment was in a prime area for us to have a delicious dinner and drinks and be able to walk home! Helpful with navigating the the NY subway as well. Probably use again when I'm in the city. Thanks again!

903947,Harlem,"Very great location... near public transportation. Host is nice and available to assist. Room was as advertised. You are free to do things at your leisure. Room is a little warm without AC or a fan, street noise outside and walk up. Host was nice enough to help me take my luggage down. Perfect for someone who just want to be in and out, run errands or need a short stay."
6663416,Harlem,Abe was a great host! Me and my friend stayed for 9 nights and the room was very clean and neat. We could lock the door which was nice. Abe and his kids where very welcoming! The D train is only two blocks away and will take you downtown very quick. Would highly recommend this room! 
1937226,Harlem,"The spacious appartment is ideally located in a very nice neighbourhood, close to restaurants and metro. The appartement was very well equiped and clean. There was a usefull file with all practival information.

There were some problems with the toilet but luckilly they were rapidly fixed by the owner. The airco only cooled one room to satisfaction.

The communication needed for check in was way too extensive and rather impersonal, not in line with the owners pleasant tone of voice when booking the appartment.  

We wrongly interpreted the check out time and this was handled pretty harshly.

1347204,Harlem,"Moi et mes amies avons été très satisfaits de notre séjour chez London. L'appartement est tout à fait conforme à la description et nous a été livré impeccablement propre. Je la recommande chaudement. Les chambres sont très calmes mais si quelqu'un doit coucher dans le salon, ne pas oublier les bouchons pour les oreilles, la rue Lenox est assez bruyante. De très bons restos à proximité. Bref, un séjour des plus agréable. London est même venue nous secourir à 8 heures du matin car nous avions oublié un sac à l'intérieur, et avec le sourire."

3771962,Harlem,"Stephan reached out shortly after I booked and provided the name and cell number of his assistant who would meet my family when we arrived. The apartment was very clean, well stocked with all the necessaries, and comfortably appointed. It looked just as it does in the photos. The space more than met our needs for our one night stay. The heat was noisy in one of the three bedrooms, so put the heavy sleeper in there. ;) Overall, a good stay."

4469650,Harlem,"Elizabeth var en fantastisk vert. Hun tok imot oss med et stort smil (og en flaske vin) når vi kom og vi følte oss velkommen. Hadde vi noe vi lurte på kunne vi ringe og sende sms når vi måtte,og Elizabeth svarte med en gang. Dagene i New york gikk til sightseeing og shopping og da var det ekstra herlig å komme tilbake til dette vakre huset og slappe av om kvelden. Vi spiste frokost i huset og kjøpte inn matvarer i en matbutikk kun 2/3 minutter fra huset. Et skikkelig sentralt hus med kort vei til metro,butikk, cafeer og restauranter(Sylvias restaurant var vår favoritt). Kan virkelig anbefale huset til familier/ venner som reiser sammen. Vi kommer gjerne tilbake. "
4325502,Harlem,"We had a great experience at Loni's apartment. The location is fantastic--in the heart of Harlem, very close to numerous subway lines for moving around the city, a wide range of restaurants, jazz clubs, etc. The apartment is spacious, comfortable and full of original brownstone woodwork and charm. The beds are comfy, the kitchen stocked with coffee, tea and other cooking stuff, and the shower has great hot water and excellent water pressure. Check out and check in were both extremely smooth and easy. We greatly appreciated their flexibility with our checkin and checkout times and the quick replies to our emails. All of this made for a smooth and enjoyable stay. "
5262076,Harlem,"Upon arriving at Alfredo's we were greeted warmly by him and 2 other couples staying at the apt. Our room was small and cozy with a big window giving us a ""lofty"" feel. Overall enjoyed our stay here. Would recommend to anyone looking for a small cozy room and potential meeting new people. "
10088612,Harlem,"The stay at Victor's was better then we could have hoped for. The bed was fantastic and comfortable and Victor was so helpful during the entire stay. He even held our bags for us while we were out and about. The place is safe and secure with coded access to the main house and keys to lock our own room as well. 

Victor was easy to contact the entire time if we needed anything at all and was happy to help with some amazing dinner recommendations. 

The room is also close to a subway stop that will take you into Times Square with one train. 

We know where to stay next time we come back to New York! "

The apartment along with andrea were very nice, clean and inviting.
I wasn't able to spend too much time with andrea as i was travelling most of the time but the time we were together he always gave me genuine and good  advice regarding nyc.

1919766,Harlem,"Edda was very available and had the room prepared well upon arrival. It was exactly as described in the ad, which was just what we needed. Very easy to get to the metro and the D line is a very quick ride to midtown or wherever you need to go downtown. If you're looking for basic accommodation with two separate beds, this is a perfect place."
1619695,Harlem,"Chikie est un hôte très accueillant, il nous a reçu chez lui à 1h30 du matin car notre vol est arrivé tard à New York JFK (Compter deux heures de transports depuis JFK). Il a toujours essayé de répondre au mieux à nos attentes lorsque nous avions besoins de conseils pour notre séjour.

La chambre est comme sur les photos, elle est équipée d'un dressing et de deux grands miroirs. Le lit est confortable et parfait pour deux personnes.
C'est la chambre qui est à louer mais tout l'appartement était à notre disposition : salon (équipée d'une TV + home cinéma), cuisine équipée, salle de bain. Chikie, lorsqu'il était chez lui, restait dans sa chambre et se montrait discret.

Les deux seuls petits bémols :
- La chambre qui ne peut être verrouillée à clé (le verrou est usé et s'ouvre sans trop forcé même lorsque la poignée est bloquée par la clé). Néanmoins, Chikie semble être un hôte responsable et de confiance, il n'est jamais venu ne serait-ce que toquer à la porte pendant le séjour.
- Ma femme a vu un petit cafard dans la cuisine (à deux reprises). L'appartement est pourtant très propre, entretenu et épuré, cela provient surement du voisinage.

L'appartement est très bien situé, dans le quartier de Harlem, à trois minutes à pied de la station 137th street sur la ligne 1 du métro. On peut se rendre en 15-20 min à Times Square et en 10 min à Central Park. Il y a également un bus juste devant le bâtiment sur Amsterdam avenue.

Le voisinage est vraiment sympathique, nous n'avons pas eu de sentiment d'insécurité. Ambiance portoricaine au rendez-vous ! Le quartier est très vivant durant la soirée.

Pour conclure, je ne peux que vous recommander de choisir Chikie comme hôte, notamment pour le rapport qualité/prix qu'il propose. Nous avons vraiment apprécié notre séjour !"

8753832,Harlem,Ed was awesome and such a great host! This was our first experience with Airbnb and it could have not have been any better! He made our experience to New York very easy. He offered great tips about the city and was readily available if we ever needed to ask him a question. The pictures are very accurate. The room is very private and perfect for one or two people. It almost felt like we had our own place for the weekend because Ed lives downstairs and we had our own access into the apartment. I especially loved the bathroom. The apartment is near a subway station so access to the city was quick and easy. I would highly recommend staying here and hope to come back in the future as well! 
5152230,Harlem,"這個房間算是房東家的客廳,一旁就是廚房,廚房旁有扇門通到房東的臥室。雖然不大但住起來還滿舒適,出門走路3分鐘便能到達地鐵站,對於晚歸的旅客而言是很理想的地點。房間乾淨程度普普。另外房東本人在溝通上很積極,回應很快速。有什麼問題也都算滿願意溝通的。是可以納入考慮的房源囉!"
1877244,Harlem,"Theresa's apt was more than amazing. It was so homey, very spacious, its like 2 apts in one. The second room is downstairs with its own bathroom, so you dont have to worry about sharing one. The location was perfect, literally around the block from the subway, and the neighborhood was great. Theresa was more than helpful in accommodating my request for an early check in, and she was very quick at responding to my emails. I highly recommend this location and ill definitely be staying here again. Thank you theresa!!! "
5806273,Harlem,Carlina was a great host! She was flexible and accessible at all times. She greeted us when we came in and gave us a tour. She let us use all of the utilities and facilities in the house. She also respected our privacy the entire stay. Definitely would recommend her to anyone. 
2473861,Harlem,"Me hospede en el departamento de grover con 4 amigas más por 10 días y la pasamos increíble! Nos recibieron muy bien, con mucha buena onda y energía! El departamento es más de lo que esperábamos, muy cómodo y la ubicacion muy accesible.
No podríamos haber elegido un lugar mejor para hospedarnos, la pasamos increíble!"
258412,Harlem,"Kelly's place was very nice. The apartment matched the picture which was very impressive. Everything worked great I.e. TV, Internet, AC, stove etc. she had lots of complimentary items which was great. Kelly was always there when we needed her and always willing to help ! I would stay at her place again ! "
3978543,Harlem,"Spent 5 nights in Anita's penthouse apartment mid-Nov.  It was awesome.  The unit is very spacious, very clean, and very comfortable.  The space is decorated beautifully, designer touches, hard wood floors, great lighting.  
Some things we really appreciated--a comfortable King sized bed, working WIFI, the well stocked kitchenette for to reheat our leftovers and chill our booze. 
And finally the location--incredible bang for your buck.  The 2, 3 express train is a right there.  Or a $20 uber ride to most spots. Good dinning options in close proximity and a CVS a half block away. 
Highly recommend this space if you can book it! "
1688914,Harlem,"Staying in Joy's place was a magnificent experience! My family and I got everything we could've asked for. 

The night we arrived, everything was in proper condition and ready for us to enjoy. The apartment, while not huge, is spacious and comfortable for a family of four, even a few more people would fit comfortably. In case you need housing for extra people, ask Joy. The place is fully furnished and equipped except for a washing machine and a dryer, but there's a laundromat a few blocks away so that'd be no problem. 

The bed and the sofa-bed are comfortable and clean. We'd walk an average of 100 blocks per day, and after that, there's no better place to be than in a comfortable bed. 

The place has very fast wireless internet, so you can work at night or whenever you need to without worrying about speed drops or peaks. It has a small TV and cable, but I can't comment much on that since we probably turned it on just two times, but seems to work perfectly fine. 

The neighbourhood is lively, and can be kinda noisy at night. I think there's a police/fire dept. station nearby, so you'll hear sirens from time to time, but it's not a big deal. I can say it's quieter than most of Midtown. The subway and almost everything (grocery stores, restaurants, laundromats, etc) is within walking distance and easily accessible. As for the safety, it's NYC, like with every big city, you just have to keep your eyes wide open, but honestly speaking, I felt very safe walking around even at ungodly hours. 

Joy is a wonderful host, very polite and eager to help. She gave us enough information to move around the neighbourhood without having to ask for much else. Meeting her was a refreshing experience. Just follow the rules and be a good neighbour and I'm sure you experience will be as good as mine.

1096511,Harlem,Ifé has been very friendly. The room was as it is described here but a little bit noisy. The place was very clean and I had all the amenities I could need. The area is safe and the view of the park from the living room is beautiful. 
903972,Harlem,"The room itself is clean and comfortable with many amenities nearby and we felt safe walking home at night. It is also in a great location for exploring Manhattan as it is close to the subway which runs all night. It is up five flights of stairs however, and the stairwell in the building is disgusting and was littered with beer cans and used condoms (although I don't suppose there is much the host can do about that). I wasn't entirely satisfied with the key exchange either. Joe was not there to meet us as we had been told, We were left waiting on the sidewalk after having to call his cell several times to find out which apartment we were in. After knocking repeatedly, we were then left waiting outside the apartment, eventually let in by other guests. It turned out that Joe was at work and his friend, who he had left there to meet us, was in his room with the door closed, apparently unaware of our presence. We were just left sitting in the apartment for 10 mins not knowing what to do. I understand that people have to work but I think it would have been helpful to have a contact number for the friend who was supposed to be letting us in to the apartment."
58059,Harlem,"Agnes is a very nice hote. She's there if you need help about anything. The place is well-located, the subway is near the flat. I enjoyed my stay at New York. I recommend the place of Agnes."
5826013,Harlem,"Great location,five mins walking to the 1 train which can take you anywhere in the Manhattan, many groceries and restaurants around so you don't have to worry about the food at all. A state park is just 5 mins walking away which is very beautiful,Cameron's place is better than described, very clean and big enough space, we felt like at home all the time and all his roommates are very nice and helpful and even made us dinner! We enjoyed the days there and highly recommend this place to all people!!"
3122027,Harlem,"Rich and Anthony were great hosts, while we didn't see each other that often whenever we did they made me feel welcome, gave me advice, checked in how I was finding everything. They had a helpful little binder of information about New York ready in the room, and included a few of the local places to eat which was great. Room was exactly as presented, nice and comfortable to come back to after a busy day exploring New York."
6093625,Harlem,"My brother and sister and I took our 86 year old mom to NYC so that she could see some things that she wanted to see.  Monica and Sergio's apartment was perfect for us.  It was roomy, comfy and functional.  It is pretty and spotless just as in the pictures and everything works.  The view of the Hudson and the sunsets was spectacular.  The apartment is also quiet- almost no street noise and no noise from neighbors.  We slept great. The building is slightly funky but the residents are friendly and we felt very welcome as we came and went. 
The location is great next to the subway."
6586028,Harlem,"We had a wonderful time at Karyn's, the location is excellent with ready access to the subway. The apartment is spacious and very well air conditioned which is important on hot days in New York. We felt quite comfortable in the location even at night time.

The supplies provided by Karyn as well as the tourist information was much appreciated.

We would highly recommend  Karyn's apartment"
12057450,Harlem,"Small but with so much character you won't even notice it, Austin's place is great for a stay in uptown. Very clean and nicely decorated whenever I have events in this part of the city again I would love to stay here!"
1831227,Harlem,"I felt very privileged to stay at David's apartment. He was more than accommodating and always responsive to any needs I might have had (he was more than gracious regarding my ignorance with basic 2014 staples, ie the remote control). 

The bed? Amazing. I've been meaning to ask him where he got the mattress bc I want the exact same one, not kidding. "

Location is perfect if you want to visit NYC with quick access to subway including the express line. Harlem is a very nice place and you have a supermarket one block away.

The place is very clean and comfortable and David is a very pleasent host! In one word I can only recommend David and his appartment for your trip. 

Thanks again a lot David!"

L'appartement est au 4e étage sans ascenseur, mais cela ne nous a pas posé de problème.
Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer John mais il nous a donné toutes les informations nécessaires et il a répondu à nos questions. John est un hôte prévenant et attentif.

3360707,Harlem,"Hugo e sua mãe foram muito simpáticos o tempo todo e me deixaram bastante tranquilos com relação à hospedagem. O quarto é pequeno e humilde, mas bastante decente, com tv e ótimo para descansar após um dia de muita caminhada em NYC. Próximo ao metrô e com bastante comércio perto. Me senti um pouco inseguro para andar sozinho muito tarde, mas na verdade eu não vi nada de errado acontecer."
5192219,Harlem,"Great brownstone filled, tree-lined neighborhood. The room looks exactly like the photograph and it was clean. Glenda was kind and helpful via text. The only problem was the toilet was broken the entire time we were there. She responded to the problem immediately, unfortunately it took a while to get it repaired. Overall, a mostly positive experience."

1914231,Harlem,"I haven’t even been home a week and I have already recommended Ferris’ gorgeous apartment to several friends! It is exactly as it is shown on the website – stylish, private and with everything you need. Including the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! 

Ferris was at the end of the phone if we needed her and when we met her she was friendly and helpful, offering to keep our bags for us after checkout on our last day. 

The location is brilliant – Harlem is a fantastic, vibrant place. We spent some time just mooching around admiring the architecture and within just a few minutes’ walk of the apartment there are fantastic restaurants, parks and all the local amenities you might need. The apartment itself was surprisingly quiet considering how close we were to all the hustle and bustle of Lenox Avenue and it’s just a few blocks away from the subway (125th Street) so it is extremely well-connected. 

Thank you so much for having us, Ferris – we hope to be back one day!

I liked that the bed faces a TV panel which has tonnes of channels - great for in-room entertainment. "

3671653,Harlem,"Toyin's place is amazing! It's just as good as it looks in the pictures and you have everything you could need like wifi, maps of the city, air con etc. Toyin is the best host you could ask for, really friendly and accommodating, she was so generous and really spoilt us during our stay there. She also helped us out with some local recommendations, was always happy to have a chat but also gave us privacy too. A perfect host! It's a great neighborhood as well, so much culture and character. Close to central park and the metro. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
9315567,Harlem,"Kandisann was an amazing host and super kind. Her place is very nice and right near the beautiful Central Park. Her dog is the sweetest thing and you do not have to worry about her. There is a subway right by that will take you into the city where you can shop, visit restaurants or go sight seeing. I'm so happy I found a really good place like this to stay for my visit, and next time I'm in New York I will stay here again. I highly recommend her. "

Dependes del metro para moverte pero esta muy cerca (5 min) y tiene supermercado al lado de casa. Lo aconsejo sin ninguna duda, Pacino un anfitrión genial, te facilita lo que necesitas."
9121896,Harlem,Maxime is a wonderful host!  He went a mile further so as to make my stay as comfortable and as pleasant as possible. He made me feel at home and helped me with everything I needed. I will definitely stay at Maxime's apt again and again. He's a 5 star host!!

7762374,Harlem,"Emilia gave us great help and details to check in and patient to wait for us because of long time for the customs we were late for 2 hours more to the house. It's raining and cold at that day, Emilia heated the rooms and felt so warm when we arrived. Thanks Emilia so much. The house was very big and many beds for us 6 persons, about 25 minutes driving to Time Square. Beds were comfortable and slept well, only a little noisy at midnight sometimes, but mostly were quiet. 3 bathrooms were good for us shower easily.  That's good for more than 6 persons stayed here."

Please note that the house has 3 floors, probably described already in the home description. No escalator. So if you have a big suitcase, you need muscles :)"

 The area is calm and safe, It was completely quiet in the mornings and I felt pretty safe walking back home at nights. 
I will be staying with them again if I ever go back to new york. Thank you guys for being such lovely hosts, hope to see you again! :-)"
1856219,Harlem,"Desde nuestra llegada Vladimir fue un muy buen anfitrión. Nos estaba esperando a pesar de que nuestro vuelo se atrasó un poco e incluso nos ayudó a subir las maletas al departamento. Al llegar el lugar me pareció un poco distinto a las fotos, era porque había remodelado la cocina y ahora era incluso aún mejor! Su departamento es muy amplio y acogedor, al igual que Vladimir, quien también es muy generoso y amable. Estoy muy agradecida de su buena disposición y su confianza al dejarnos entrar y formar parte de su hogar por los días que estuvimos yo y mi novio en NY, realmente nos sentimos muy cómodos. La pieza sí que era tal cual el anuncio, la cama muy cómoda y el espacio bastante amplio, es lo justo y necesario.
El barrio era muy entretenido; cerca del departamento hay restaurantes, bares y markets para comprar de todo, sitios de interés, está cerca de dos líneas del metro y al lado del central park, por lo que hay un poco de todo para hacer sólo recorriendo los alrededores.
Esta fue mi primera experiencia en Airbnb y fue excelente! De todas maneras si vuelvo a NY volvería a hospedarme con Vladimir. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
11604709,Hell's Kitchen,"The location was perfect - just 2minute walk to Times Square, the bus station and the subway. Michael was very helpful, answered all of our questions and the appartment was exactly as he described it in the website.

13496230,Hell's Kitchen,"I chose this room because of the location, 5 minute walk from Times Square, 10 minute walk to Central Park and great subway connections all around. Thomas was an excellent host and always checking if we needed anything, even getting us coffee in the mornings! The main thing to note is the property has 5 flights of stairs to reach it, with no elevator, so think about how much luggage you're bringing. The room is very small so you'll struggle if you have more than 2 suitcases. apart from that, I would highly recommend staying here. It puts you bang in the centre of New York!"
6247046,Hell's Kitchen,"Great location; host was there at check in to show us around and explain the policies.  I would however take exception to the claim that the beds are finished with 500 thread count Luxury Italian Linens and fluffy Duvets.  The beds had no mattress pads, bottom fitted sheets or top flat sheets.  A flat sheet was used in place of a fitted sheet and was the only linen between the mattress and the vinyl encasement.  This made  for a very ""loose"" bottom sheet which was rather hot against the vinyl, and no top sheet, duvet only.  
Overall, I give this apt 4 stars due to the location and cleanliness."

Joana was super easy to work with...check-in was a breeze, apartment was very clean and had everything we needed, Joana responded to all communication promptly...we couldn't have asked for anything more.  Would be happy staying here again during next visit.  Book it...you will not be disappointed."
4121879,Hell's Kitchen,"Mahfud was a great host! The room we stayed in ""Hellz Kitchen"" was great just like the photos and I believe it was one of the biggest rooms. The bedrooms and bathrooms were nice a clean. Best part was we stayed in a very convenient area that was 5min walk from time square and the sub way. Mahfud made sure all are needs were met. You do have to walk a few stairs cases to get to the room which was no problem for us. As long as you respect the house rule you should be fine. Many places to eat and drink in that area. "
5178,Hell's Kitchen,"I recently stayed at Shun's apartment (Sept 2010).
The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Manhattan. It is a close walking distance to times square, and major subways that makes commuting around NY very easy.
I was in NY to take dance classes, and Shun's apartment was perfectly located within walkiing distance to Broadway Dance Centre (10-15mins), Steps on Broadway (20 mins) and Ailey Dance Centre (5-10 mins).  
Shun was very hospitable allowing me to use his lap top and internet.  The room was spacious and entirely adequate as I only came back late at night to sleep for a few hours. The facilities were clean and adequate.
Yes it can be a little noisy at nigh which made sleeping a little difficult, but the room, its location and the hosts were exactly what i needed for this trip.  
I would thoroughly recommend this apartment to any single or couple looking to stay somewhere convenient in NY."

12982169,Hell's Kitchen,"This room wasn't a hotel. We were greeted very nicely. Our room was very comfy and pleasant until we discovered it was over a nightclub that didn't close until 4:00 am!!!
We did ask for extra pillows which we were told there were none. They offered us a very nice complementary breakfast. 
We finally were moved on the third day. The room was queen not King. 
The rooms were clean and pleasant. Just kinda noisy. 
Front seek people were very nice. 
We never did get extra pillows. "
13760302,Hell's Kitchen,"The description is accurate and the stay was pleasant. Granted, I picked a budgeted stay for an in-and-out trip to nyc, but the host Han stayed up to accommodate my late arrival and made sure I was able to get in. Know what to expect and this will be a great stay."

Nosotros no pudimos conocernos en persona, por diferencias horarias, pero él lo gestionó todo para que fuera posible nuestra llegada sin ningún problema. Responde rápidamente a tus mensajes y si necesitas algo está disponible para ayudarte. Esto es muy importante ya que genera confianza y cumple con esta expectativa.

El piso está céntrico y al acceso de todo, especialmente si es la primera vez que viajas a New York. Aunque la zona es ruidosa, de noche la calle es tranquila y se descansa muy bien, también gracias al buen colchón que tiene.  Tiene supermercados cerca, bares y restaurantes, varias entradas de metro, Time Square, la estación de buses Port Authoryty, teatros, Central Park... 
El piso está bien para dos personas, para tres yo creo que iría muy justo, ya que el espacio es reducido.
Todo estaba ordenado y más o menos limpio, a nivel doméstico. Por el precio que se paga nos hubiera gustado encontrarnos el piso realmente limpio en todas las áreas, así como una cocina mejor acondicionada para su uso. El mobiliario está viejo y no nos gustó encontrarnos comida abierta en los muebles y la nevera."

Unfortunately there was no bedding on the beds for my 2 kids and we were told that it was too late at night to do anything about. We received a £50 refund for this inconvenience.
"
9737840,Hell's Kitchen,"Alex was an exceptional host.  Long before we arrived he was assisting me with questions and locations.  Never did any of my questions go unanswered.  He was very helpful with taking our bags to the apt.  He is also mindful of the surrounding businesses and makes sure that we are not blocking their entrances when waiting for a ride to the airport.   The apt was perfect, room on each end, we did not take advantage of the kitchen, but it was fully stocked with dishes and cookware.  The beds are comfortable and Alex made sure that there was plenty of fresh towels.  All in all, Alex made our trip to NYC very enjoyable.  Look forward to renting from him again."

4564292,Hell's Kitchen,Great apartment. Very close to Times Square and still nice and quiet for sleeping at night.
1294438,Hell's Kitchen,"Firstly, Jeremy is a great host. He was able to accommodate me with literally an hours notice. Nothing was too much trouble and he was always happy to take the time to give me any information needed as this was my first trip to NYC and I was by myself.
The location is perfect, literally a 2-3 minute walk and your in Times Square, a 5 minute walk to Central Park, and the apartment itself is positioned well enough so that your not caught up in the hustle of it all and is actually fairly quiet.
The bedroom and bathroom is nice and private and the bed is really comfy.
The kitchen was on offer for me to use but I didn't use it during my stay.
Jeremy has a great sense of humour, we shared some great laughs and I would not hesitate to recommend him or his apartment, i will definitely visit again.
Hope this helps ;)

4642539,Hell's Kitchen,"This was our first time in NYC and we had a really nice trip. Annika was very responsive and available during the whole process and did an amazing job to compile nice places to visit and provide useful information for the use of the apartment. The apartment was clean and comfortable, we were a family of 3 couples (2 young, 1 elderly) and appreciated having each our own space without having to use the living room. The space at the top of the ladder requires a little of gym but was fine for a young couple and would be for children as well. We also really appreciated the dining table where we could easily sit altogether. The kitchen has all the necessary equipment and the bathroom has a bathtub with a shower hose which is really nice as well. The location was also ideal, 7 min walk to port authority and 3 min walk to groceries. It was very convenient to reach the ""touristic places"". I would definitely recommend this apartment!"
7788126,Hell's Kitchen,"Andrew and Neal were very accommodating to us and we greatly appreciated that. This is in a great location in NY. The place did have issues though. A few maintenance issues need to be addressed  but most of all they need new beds , pillows , linens and towels. These are a must for all guests. "
1498148,Hell's Kitchen,We had a wonderful time in NYC and it was in part due to the superb location of Daniel's apt. The room in the apt is very private and the bathroom is new and clean. Daniel kindly offered us the use of his kitchen which we found to be a very kind gesture. I would highly recommend Daniel's apt as a place to stay. 
7858468,Hell's Kitchen,Great host.  Location very close to Time Square and everything else.  Very chatty and got on well.  I would stay with Jeffrey again.

3386696,Hell's Kitchen,"Great apartment close to Time square, Metro and Hell’s Kitchen (head to Hell’s Kitchen for breakfast/dinner, much better than chain restaurants near time square!). It was lovely and clean and surprisingly quiet inside given its location. The room with 2 double beds is large with drawer space, a good sized wardrobe, chair and space to move about without knocking into each other. The second smaller room is tight but fine for sleeping, it could do with a few hooks on the wall to hang things on. Overall nicely decorated, clean and a great base for exploring the city. Only thing which may be an issue for some people is that it is up 2 flights of stairs which was only a slight problem when moving our luggage. 

We didn't get to meet Robert, but he was in regular contact before we arrived and during our trip.
Thank you "
8613175,Hell's Kitchen,Was spacious for us 5 adults plus 7 luggages. Very clean. I can even walk barefoot. Love the interior.

13329001,Hell's Kitchen,"Had a great stay at this studio apartment. Location was fantastic. Easy access to Time's Square and Central Park as well as the HighLine.  The subway is close by and made it easy to get down to Lower Manhattan.  Great little restaurants around the corner on 9th. The room was clean and had what was promised.  It's small...but you cannot go wrong for the price.  It's a bit noisy for those who are sensitive, but we had no problem sleeping through it all after a busy day exploring.  Thanks Bijan and Samira.

Bed is super comfortable.  Restaurants and grocery stores all around.  Chunlan is a gracious host and met us early at the apartment so we could drop off our backpacks before heading up to the Met.   She made everything so easy for us during our stay.   Fantastic place and host...I definitely would recommend, and plan on staying here again in the future! "
13698429,Hell's Kitchen,"The whole experience was great and I do not have any complaints about our stay. We arrived to NYC late in the night and Jordan was kind enough to wait almost three hours past our expected arrival time with no issues. He showed us the place and gave us a few tips for our visit. They even had handmade laminated flyers with their recommendations on food and other important information that was helpful. I loved that and thought it was so helpful and kind! The apartment itself was exactly what I expected based off the pictures. It was clean and cozy, probably can fit 4 comfortably at most. Great location, close to Times Square and the subway stops. Jordan was great at communicating with us during our stay and responded quickly to any questions we had. Would definitely rent again with them when visiting NYC. "

5441,Hell's Kitchen,"Being at Kate's was a beautiful experience! 
Kate is a wonderful host, the flat is nice and clean and it takes five minutes to walk to Times Square.
Only one warning: be careful, you could be trapped by her beautiful library and spend all your time in New York reading her books!  ;-))"
790679,Hell's Kitchen,"We felt very welcomed by the House keeper Soli. She was waiting to greet us with keys upon arrival. 

The apartment is pretty much exactly as advertised, it's actually a little bigger than it looks. 7 of us were comfortable in the apartment. 

Location is insanely good. If you're willing to take buses, subways or cabs, you can get pretty much get anywhere in the city pretty quickly. 

Tons of great restaurants, theatres and attractions within walking distance.

We didn't have to contact Soli at all during our stay because we had 0 issues, however if we did, I feel like she would have done anything to resolve the situation.

10/10 in my opinion, I would definitely come back! "

1213991,Hell's Kitchen,"Steve was an amazing host. He met us upon arrival, assisted in making sure we knew where everything was and answered our questions throughout the planning process for our trip as well as once there.  The apartment was very clean and it truly felt like having a lil home to come to after our busy days in the city.  Since this is a trip that I do almost every summer, I would very much welcome the opportunity to stay at this apartment and work with Steve on the future. "

26362,Hell's Kitchen,"Luiz ist ein sehr sympathische Gastgeber und jederzeit telefonisch erreichbar. die Wohnung ist super gelegen. Ohne umzusteigen, kommt man fast direkt vor der Wohnung an. Der Time square lst um die Ecke, wie auch der Zugang zur Subway. Ich kann diese Unterkunft nur empfehlen. Zwar ist die Toilette draußen auf dem Flur, aber das stört nicht. 
Für die Lage und zu dem angebotenen Preis einfach unschlagbar. 
Erschlagen vom morgendlichen Spaziergang?! Kurz in die Wohnung und entspannen ohne viel Zeit zu verlieren, ist jederzeit möglich. Geschäfte sind fussläufig erreichbar.
Zwar ist das Zimmer sehr klein, aber wofür braucht man in New York ein großes Zimmer?"

11983644,Inwood,I arrived late in the evening and Shantell was very accommodating. The room and the bathroom were clean and the bed was comfortable. The room had an air conditioner so I could adjust the temperature to my comfort.
9518,Inwood,Doris is very welcoming and we enjoyed our stay. Weekends can be a problem some times because of someone playing loud music through the night. Otherwise the place is very conveniently located and a safe neighborhood.
385190,Inwood,"Brace was a very gracious host and available for any questions.  His apartment is a comfortable one bedroom and can sleep 2 couples.  Inwood is a lovely residential neighborhood and the apartment is around the block from Inwood Park, the last original forest in Manhattan at the tip of Manhattan where the rivers meet.  Great trails for walking and running.  Convenient to the A and 1 train which gets you into Times Square in about 45 minutes.
We had a great time exploring the neighborhood and discovering this part of Manhattan!  And if you like pets, Lucy is the most friendly green-eyed cat!"

We arrived later than expected and my phone was not working so I couldn’t contact the hosts but they waited for us and checked us in.
The room/bathroom is super clean and comfortable. The location is great, we had no trouble walking back and to the train station and catching the train into Manhattan. We had a super early flight from LGA which was literally a 6 min car ride, so anyone flying in and out of LGA this is the perfect location. Thank you."
830482,Jackson Heights,I just stayed one night with Femida and it was just fine for my student needs. The room has everything you need and some personal decoration. There is a 24-market nearby which was also quite helpful.

In unserem Zimmer waren frische Handtücher bereitgestellt und frische Bettwäsche , sowie Seife und ein Föhn.
Wir konnten Samuel jederzeit Fragen stellen und er war sehr kommunikativ .

Es war eine tolle Zeit dort und wir würden die Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen,da die Wohnung auch sehr zentral an der U-bahn liegt und man in ca. 20min in Manhatten ist.

9145202,Jamaica,"Dona was awesome & so was her Queens location. I flew in the night before my hubby & needed a decent place close to freeway to get a couple hours rest before he got there. I didn't get to Dona's place till about 1130 due to my flight time but Dona was up & excited to show me around. 
Her place was a quick maybe 7 min drive from JFK, it was clean and even offered morning coffee & breakfast sandwiches if I wanted. Bed was comfy, shower was awesome- water temp & pressure. Room had WiFi & TV w/cable oh & a humidifier that Dona made sure she plugged in for me"

3513138,Jamaica,"This being my secomd visit, my experience was very welcoming and comfortable. Looking forward to another pleasant and relaxing stay."
6908837,Jamaica,This place was a life saver after getting forced to rebook a JFK flight back home to Oregon. Within minutes of getting told by the airline (thanks a lot Delta) that we would need to fly out the following day we had booked a room with Mrs. T and had an Uber coming our way.  The cozy room and a pantry stuffed with delicious comfort food salvaged what was otherwise a pretty crappy night. Getting to the airport was a breeze the next morning. Would highly recommend this place to someone going in or out of JFK in need of an easy place to crash. Thanks again!
13329706,Kew Gardens Hills,"Staying at Shahar's apartment was nothing short of magnificent. He's very kind, his apartment is very clean, he told me how to commute with public transportation, and supplied me clean towels! I would recommend this apartment to anybody that's thinking about planning a trip to New York. Shahar was out of town during my stay at his apartment and everytime I texted him, we quickly responded to my questions and answered every question I had. The neighborhood is in a very quiet area and the neighbors were kind! Also, there's multiple eating spots in the area that are walking distance. Overall, my trip was excellent and I would recommend anybody to stay at Shahar's apartment!"
953314,Kips Bay,"Very confortable apartment and in a such great location in Manhattan, being close to subway stations and also the citibike station...

3534379,Kips Bay,Rachel and John did a great job explaining all the details of the apartment as well as the neighborhood.  I would definitely stay at their apartment again.
4098642,Kips Bay,Check in was an ease. Cristina was easy to get a hold of. The penthouse was close to a rite aid and grocery store so anything you needed was across the street. Only negative thing I can say is that the place needs some minor repairs little things were not working or had holes in it but it looked like they were fixing what they can when people aren't there. Would definitely stay there again. 
5101578,Kips Bay,Shelly was an awesome host. The place was clean and comfortable and Shelly was able to accommodate a late checkout.

Emplacement idéal à quelques pas de l'empire stage building. Bien desservi par le métro. Le quartier animé de Times square est trés proche mais sans les inconvénients des nuisances sonores nocturnes. Pour les courses, trés pratique  un déli  se trouve à l'angle de la rue. Les propriètaires qui travaillent sur place sont acceuillants et arrangeants. Ils nous ont permis de laisser les bagages sur place le dernier jour car notre avion ne décollait que le soir et Sylvia nous a bien aidé pour la communication en américain au sujet de notre navette pour l'aéroport. Encore merci à elle!"

68974,Little Italy,Ali is a great host! Everything was as stated in the description of her place. A couple of times I texted her about occasions/clubs/restaurants in NY and she answered fast with good help to us tourists in NY. From her flat you see the entrance to Chinatown and a few blocks away is Little Italy. One block to the subway. Perfect location!
3210405,Little Italy,"This apartment is in such an amazing part of town. You are right in the middle of everything good in Lower Manhattan. Chinatown is a block away, Soho a few blocks west, Little Italy all around you. The coffee, bar, and restaurant choices are endless.

The apartment itself is very spacious, especially for Manhattan. As described, it is beautifully designed - exposed brick with a warm industrial feel.

Caroline was very responsive and checked in during the stay to make sure everything was going well."

He was accommodating to our needs and provided great restaurant recommendations!  Highly recommend staying at Jake's place!"

6853454,Murray Hill,"L'ubicazione descritta da Nick risulta veramente molto bella e al centro di Midtown, collegamenti e siti interessanti sono a pochi passi, ma L'alloggio non è il massimo per chi deve stare 14 giorni come me, perché la stanza è molto piccola e si trova in un cantinato sottoterra al n.107 e non al n.111. Tutto sommato Nick è stato molto disponibile è fiducioso ma dovrebbe descrivere a pieno L'alloggio. Ringrazio Nick per la sua disponibilità. La 35th east è davvero una strada al centro di New York e vicina alle più belle attrattive. Queste attrattive sarebbero ancora più valorizzate se si alloggiasse almeno in un piano terra e non sottoterra. Il quartiere è bellissimo, e Nick mi è sembrato una brava persona, ma è bene essere più chiari nella descrizione della casa. 
Grazie Nick per la tua ospitalità. "

5236904,Long Island City,Laura and Anthony really made us feel welcome in their apartment. They are very friendly and trusted us to use their room. We've also had some great conversations about the New York people and living there. We would definitely stay here another time! 
2028432,Long Island City,"Cynthia and Mirlet made me a very warm welcome, and actually the shared room turned to be a real home where I had  a lot of space for me: Cynthia and Myrla weren't there but for few moments, always busy or just retired in the other floor, so that they were almost invisible, but always available in case of need. Should I come in New York, either for a short or a long stay, I would be happy to come back ""home"" there."
333175,Long Island City,"Place was great!  Clean, ready to go, easy to find.  Yusnier even texted me to make sure I found my way when I was lost on the subway at night.  Excellent overall experience."
8488273,Long Island City,Anne's place and her roommates are really nice. I didn't get to meet Anne but she was really helpful whenever i had any question. One of the best thing about Anne place is the rooftop. Also you get good view from East river which is 2 minutes walk from apartment. I loved staying at Anne's for weekend. Thank you Anne for being great host.
432090,Long Island City,"We spent eight nights at Grace’s place, and we really enjoyed our time there. The room was beautifully furnished, tidy, and, due to two windows, very bright. Although it wasn’t large, we had enough space to store our luggage. Noise levels during the nights were completely fine, especially given the location of the flat in only 3-min walking distance of two subway lines, which brought us to Manhattan in no time at all. In fact, we both enjoyed having a calm haven outside of noisy, busy Manhattan. Grace herself was a wonderful host. Very cordial, uncomplicated, unintrusive, and ready to help whenever needed, she made us feel at home and even took us to an afternoon-sightseeing tour to NYC’s “highline”, including a degustation of delicious Italian pastry. Thank you, Grace, for hosting the two of us!"
1093570,Long Island City,"Robert is really a great host. He is always ready to help and hospitable. His place is nice, clean and close to subway station. Recommend to all guests who is planing to visit Manhattan. "

2420026,Long Island City,"Stanza comodissima e accogliente, molto pulita, posizionata a soli 5 minuti a piedi dalla metro e a poche fermate di metro

Assolutamente consigliato per un soggiorno ben collegato a Manhattan ma in una zona residenziale tranquilla e soprattutto sicura del Queens. 
Consigliato per tutti, coppie giovani e adulte.
See you soon Loreta!

10924820,Long Island City,"Nery's apartment was perfect for a weekend trip to NYC - they are about a block from Court Square station, so you can quickly get anywhere in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. I arrived in NYC on an early bus and they were understanding in setting my check-in time."
2447847,Long Island City,We never met loretta but she couldn't be faulted. The keys were available when we arrived and when we left she gave us permission to leave our bags in the hall which was really useful. The location was as specified in the description. The only problem being it listed 10 people but it was way too small for 10 people.
2437965,Long Island City,Nice comfortable room in a great location.
2950760,Long Island City,"Robert's place was amazing! I was actually able to meet him while staying, and he was a very nice guy. His place is super clean and very comfy. Even for the winter months it is great because our room had its own personal heater. The location is also great. It took us about 15 mins to get to Times Square and there is a train/metro station very close by. The place is decked out for AirBnB-ers and so I would recommend it in a heartbeat. If you're thinking about booking the place, go ahead and do it because it is well worth it. "
269889,Long Island City,"Me and my husband stayed at Min's place for seven nights. It was our first experience with AirBnB and it could not have been better.
The location is great, nice and quiet neighbourhood not far from the Metro. The apartment  is clean and tidy and the room is nice with a comfortable bed.
Min is a fantastic host, she's helpful, easy going, open minded and fun to talk to. 
We can give her our best recommendations and if we ever travel to NYC again, we know the place to stay at: Min's! :)"
13659055,Long Island City,"Laureta is a lovely host with an equally lovely home. The apartment was very clean, close to public transit, had a great view, and was just a short train ride away from Manhattan. I have nothing but good things to say about my stay, and I'll most definitely stay here again my next time in NY."
11778761,Longwood,"Hostess waited up for us to arrive, and it was pretty late by the time we reached the home. Neighborhood was safe. House was super easy to find. I was aware in advance that I'd be sharing a bathroom with others but asked the day before if other rooms were rented and answer was no. To my surprise, all rooms were booked (*this did not make a difference, as bathroom was cleaned every time I used it). Did not go in any other common areas, though she did welcome us to use the TV room and kitchen. There was no noise in the house and it did not feel like someone actually lived there, almost giving the impression the entire home had rooms rented out to airbnb guests. If you are looking for JUST a place to sleep while visiting the city, this is for you. "
1286933,Lower East Side,"Had a great stay at maria's place, which is well located on the lower east side. SoHo, Williamsburg and the subway are really close by, so it's easy to get around town.

We didn't liked the condition of the apartment."
316079,Lower East Side,"Amazing location and amazing experience! The apartment was as exactly described. Very nice, neat and quaint. The location is great. Everything was just a 5-10 minute walk which made all of New York available to us. I can't stress how amazing of a location this apartment is! "
15251408,Lower East Side,Great place if you are travelling for a short stay on business and want to stay close to the action. Good communication with the host. Thanks Bryan!
2461439,Lower East Side,Steve was very welcoming when we arrived and gave us the low down on the local area and the best places to eat. The apartment was lovely and in an excellent location
7883220,Lower East Side,"Bij aankomst was Kelley aanwezig om ons te begroeten en wat bijzonderheden te vertellen over de buurt.
Het app was klein maar voldoende voor ons. Het was helaas niet erg schoon
De ligging van het app was goed. Dichtbij de highlights en een metrostation."
19319,Lower East Side,"We had a lovely time staying at Ana's. The room was pleasant and comfortable, location convenient, everything is as described. We were looked after mainly by Ana's friend Victoria who was so kind, helpful and charming. Would recommend Ana's place to anyone.

1256556,Lower East Side,"The locations was amazing and the apartment was nice. There are multiple public transportation options around.
Although we communicated through Airbnb only Caitlin was a great host; kind and welcoming!
We had no problem neither with getting keys or climbing the sixth floor :)
Recommended. "
726630,Lower East Side,"The apartment is very homey and the location is superb. Nancy is a gracious, helpful host (her husband also). It is a plus that she lives across the hall from the apartment. She was accessible by phone and it was comforting to know that should anything go amiss she was available to troubleshoot. We've stayed in other apartments in other cities where it was more cumbersome to get in touch with a host. The bed is comfortable and the shower hot water comes on instantly. Kitchen is well stocked with dishes and equipment and grocery store is only a couple of blocks away. The terrace is lovely and adds a buffer from the buildings around it. Having a doorman is a nice amenity. Close to more restaurants than one can try in a week. Good shopping areas - Uniqlo to Ralph Lauren. We've stayed previously around Times Square and Hells Kitchen but would definitely stay in this part of town again. "
17142073,Lower East Side,Really cool spot that looks exactly like in the photos.  You can’t beat the location as it’s in prime Lower East Side with tons of stuff to do within walking distance of the apartment. John is very accommodating and always willing to help and answer questions. Overall a great deal and will certainly look to stay here again in the future.
2065391,Lower East Side,"Allie's home is beautiful and so welcoming! It was the perfect space for us, and right next to all the great bars and restaurants in LES. Even though her apartment was in the middle of everything, it was still really quiet and peaceful being inside. She was also very flexible with check-in/check-out times which we appreciated! 

Would recommend Allie's home for anyone visiting NYC."
3120723,Lower East Side,"Julia was very friendly and quick and efficient with communication.  The location was convenient to walk to everything in the East Village and Lower East Side, so that was a major plus for us.  However, the studio itself was pretty funky.  EVERYTHING needs a good cleaning.  We are not that picky when it comes to accommodations usually, but the place should at the very least be clean.  Scrub the toilet, buy a new shower curtain, clean the mirrors, buy a new shower mat, dust and vacuum, clean out the fridge (their was something rotten in there)...pretty basic stuff if you are putting your place on Airbnb.  The place could be a great stay if it gets a thorough cleaning."
1880345,Lower East Side,"We rented this great apartment for a long weekend. My husband and I, my son and his two children all had a great time. Lovely space, great views and very spacious for NYC. Easy walk to subway uptown and to great neighborhoods all around. Great experience and very accommodating host. "
2730901,Lower East Side,"The apartment is small but offers enough space for 2 people, and it is, indeed, cozy!
All the important kitchen utensils were there: small coffee machine, hot water boiler, toaster, microwave oven and fridge.
Catherine's directions from JFK to her place were very clear and she also made us save money on the transit!"
834190,Lower East Side,"We had a wonderful time seeing New York, Carol and Mark were really helpful guiding us to the places we wanted to go and making sure we got off alright. We would love to come back and stay with them again. The room and the apartment is in a perfect location in New York, the area around the apartment has it all!"
6865053,Lower East Side,"The room has clean and quite simple, the bad good an the sheets clean, 
although at first it was a little cold we managed to take an electric radiator from the lobbs and to heat the room.
Although I have not met Justin we managed to communicate very well with him,he was answering our questions very fast and clear.
The apartament is in a good location and very close to the metro , 
museums and tourist locations, the neighborhood was safe and very friendly.

I think it is a good place and highly recommend.
Thanks Justin."

"
1438369,Lower East Side,"Arielle und ihr Ehemann sind  vorzügliche Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation im Vorfeld der Reise und während unseres 5-tägigen  Aufenthalts war reibungslos. Das Appartement selbst ist so wie auf den Bildern beschrieben. Den Kommentar unseres Vorgängers kann ich nicht nachvollziehen: Die Bilder empfanden wir als realitätsgetreu, also überhaupt nicht als geschönt, und es gab 2 Queen-Size-Betten, die wie in den USA üblich jeweils eine große Decke für zwei Personen hatten. Das Stadtviertel wäre bei einem erneuten Aufenthalt in NYC allerdings nicht unsere erste Wahl. Im Gegensatz zum sauberen Appartement wirkt die Gegend, in der es liegt, ein wenig schmuddelig, wie auch der Hausflur des Objekts. Die Abstriche, die man hier machen muss, werden meiner Meinung nach jedoch durch den für New Yorker Verhältnisse günstigen Mietpreis gerechtfertigt.  Vorteilhaft ist auch die unmittelbare Nähe zur Metro."
652750,Lower East Side,"Melissa's apartment was absolutely fantastic - bright, spacious and comfortable. Location was great, communication was nice and easy. Couldn't wish for more. Highly recommended!"
1755806,Lower East Side,"What a great Place to stay ! Perfect Location, Great naighberhood, and a verry  funny and friendly host

2214323,Lower East Side,It was absolutely lovely to stay at Alex&Ivys. Wonderful flat and location. Highly recommended...
763878,Lower East Side,"le quartier est très vivant, bars et restaurants, le métro est tout près à 10 mn à pied, super emplacement! Hank est très gentil et accueillant, concernant le logement, il est un peu petit, très sombre (contrairement à la photo) et un lit à mezzanine difficilement accessible sur une structure qui bouge un peu. je trouve que le prix est un peu cher pour ce que c'est ."
2193649,Lower East Side,"Had a great time there. The room is nice and clean, the rest of the apartment adorable! On the day of my check out I even was able to keep the key until that evening when I left for JFK, saved me from your lugging my bags all over town. "
8151925,Lower East Side,Autumn was a fantastic host. Our flight landed a little early and she was very responsive to early arrival. She also gave lots of recommendations on places to go and how to get to them via subway. The hardest part was all the flights of stairs! We stayed for a week and after all the walking we did coming to the apartment and walking half way was exhausting. BUT this place is ALL about location! It's close to everything and gives you a better NY feel then the tourist areas. The bathroom does need some updates and so does the penny backdrop in the kitchen. 
5591026,Lower East Side,"Sarah is a tremendous host.  She made check in and check out so seamless and easy. She is a very friendly and easy person to deal with and I really enjoyed the conversation that we had.  Sara is extremely intelligent and she really knows NYC like the back of her hand, which will make any travelers experience in the city so much better.  her place was just as advertised and I really enjoyed my stay. When I stayed there work to others staying in separate rooms, and and I never saw either of them which speaks to the fact that you have very good privacy here.  Thank you very much Sarah for a wonderful stay in NYC."
10699318,Lower East Side,"This is a nice place conveniently located near the F train, the Farmers Market and many drinking and eating places "
15284950,Lower East Side,Torrey and his friends are very friendly and helpful. The space is very large and clean.
2295816,Lower East Side,"Superou nossas expectativas.
O apartamento de  Erika foi tudo que precisávamos para passar grandes momentos em Nova York, um ótimo pouso para descanço depois de tantos passeios pela cidade. 
Apesar de não a ter conhecido pessoalmente, Erica se faz muito presente e disposta a ajudar em qualquer assunto, desde como as coisas funcionam a te arrumar um taxi para o aeroporto.
O apartamento é bem decorado, com uma excelente cama no quarto de dormir e um confortável sofá cama na sala de estar. A cozinha é bem equipada e o banheiro é grande com uma banheira para banhos relaxantes depois de um dia de passeios.
O bairro é muito agradável, cheio de restaurantes, lojas, perto da estação de metrô e com uma vibrante vida noturna.
Eu adoraria ficar lá novamente."
179670,Lower East Side,"Milan is an amazing host and very nice person. We arrived about midnight on Wednsday and he was very accommodating to let us in so late. Milan has big, neat, bright and airy apartment. You would not expect to find something that spacious in the Manhattan. The room was exactly the same as shown on the pictures: nicely decorated with comfortable bed and fresh bed linen. Clean, beautiful private bathroom as well. The apartment has everything you could need (washer, iron, hairdryer). The street is quiet, secure and almost no traffic.The location (LES) can't be better- you have everything in the area: from cosy brunch cafes, Whole foods market to famous Katz delicatessen. Williamsburg is a short walk across the river. You can easily find lots of different nightclubs, lounges and bars are within the walking distance. Safe and trendy area.

That was our first ''shared apartment'' airbnb experience and we would definitely recommend anyone to stay with Milan- it is a perfect place to stay in NYC!"
666837,Lower East Side,"We stayed at Gila's apartment for a week and everything was just fine. The apartment is quite small, which is usual in NYC, but clean and cosy. The bed is very comfortable. The location is good, walking distance to Soho and East Village, close to subway, easy to get everywhere in the city. Alice the cat seems to be one of the best cat in the world, very lovely and friendly. We were completely in love with her :) We would definitely stay there again. "
266753,Lower East Side,"I had a very short, one night stay at Sinem and Olga's place (I'm a New Yorker, but lent my apartment out to visiting relatives for a night), but it was a really enjoyable experience. I only saw Sinem midday to pick-up spare keys to her place, but she was very easy to communicate with and and was very pleasant. The apartment was small, but very cool and cozy and you can't beat the location. It's in the heart of the LES, with tons of great restaurant, nightlife and shopping options within a few blocks. And while the bedroom was small, it was more then enough for me to store my stuff while I was out and about during the day. 

Overall, a really positive experience, I would consider staying at Sinem's again for sure."

There are nice restaurants and cafes around this apartment.
I can recommend this room to other guests."
33071,Lower East Side,"The space was such a pleasure to come to at the end of the day. It takes you away from the hectic city life. It's where you find balance at the end of the day & dawn of the day. I loved everything, even though the stairs were a workout I wasn't ready for but was totally worth the cardio! Lol the rooftop is amazing!!!! Must sit there and see the sun set or rise. Perfect spot too! You can walk to so many things. "
813793,Lower East Side,"Stephen's flat located on the lower east side of Mahattan was a great place to stay while exploring New York. He made my family and I feel welcome by leaving orange juice in the fridge upon our arrival and was easy to contact if we had an questions about the flat or city. There was enough closet space to hang our tops, dresses etc. for the week which was a plus. Overall, Stephen was a great host and I would definitely stay in his flat again. The ease of walking to the subway every morning and being so close to SoHo were great features as well. "
4215595,Lower East Side,"Good neighborhood, great access to subway and places to eat.  Convenient location in the city.  Ben was a great host and will assist you with anything he can."
6492185,Manhattan Beach,"Oleh was a warm and welcoming host.  His home is super clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, and ideally located - from a quick hop to NYC to a day at the beach (Manhattan & Coney Island). I highly recommend this place if you want to experience a marvelous time in and near the Big Apple. "
645922,Midtown,This was the perfect place for us. We were visiting our son and his family so we needed a place to sleep and shower relatively close to them. Everything was exactly as pictured.  
4231819,Midtown,"Indur is a wonderful host, he kept quick and helpful communication while away. The apartment is wonderful; warm (and it was below zero during our visit), clean, spacious (3 of us fit very comfortable with plenty save for all), Indur provided enough clean towels and bed sheets. The kitchen is in a great condition with all the appliances one may need. Overall, we had a wonderful time staying at Indur's place and everyone including doormen were very helpful. I couldn't be more happy and would definitely recommend this lace to all my friends ! "
2290645,Midtown,"Great apartment in an excellent location. Even better than what it looks like in the pictures. Having lived in a few NYC apartments before, this one was HUGE. Lots of space for everyone to be comfortable. Noel was fantastic, the perfect host who was there when you needed him and very flexible and accommodating. He made it really easy to enjoy the apartment and being in the city. 

I would highly recommend anyone to stay! "
2984805,Midtown,"Tommy's flat is the perfect spot for anyone looking for a room in the heart of NYC. Conveniently located in midtown it really is walking distance to tons of different places, metro and bus lines are also available. 
The apartment itself (while not luxurious) is comfy and has everything you need. 
Tommy was out of town, but contacted me prior to arrival and had everything set up perfectly, including a long 'tips and tricks' list. Eric (his flatmate) is super nice, helpful and accommodating.
I would absolutely recommend this place!"
6800799,Midtown,Everything was excellent very cozy 
2763206,Midtown,This place is very convenient for tourists since it is in a very good position. The room is very cozy and the host is very friendly and helpful.
2145620,Midtown,Lydia was a good host. Everything went well and she responded to our messages promptly. The apartment is nice and clean. We had a good time exploring NYC. Thank you Lydia!
2023454,Midtown,"It was really nice to start with Gina for the week, she was very accommodating and made me feel welcome in NYC. If you don't mind climbing a ladder to get to bed it's the perfect home in the perfect location."
218383,Midtown,La chambre correspond parfaitement aux photos. Sarah est une personne trés agréable et arrangeante pour nous accueillir. Nous la remercions. Sarah vit avec deux petits chiens adorables et discret. Je recommande 
360400,Midtown,"We recently stayed with Candice and absolutley loved the apartment! It is in a perfect  location, close to the Empire State and a short walk to Times Square. The apartment is comfortable and was perfect for my husband and I. The highlight of our stay was meeting Candice. She is a fantastic host who answered all our questions and gave us great suggestions  for food, transport etc. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We would happily stay at this apartment again if we return to New York. Thanks so much, Candice!"
2071140,Midtown,"Sachin was very accommodating, let me check in early, met me at the apartment to give me the key and show me some useful things I might need to know during my stay. Checkout was simply a matter of leaving my key behind, so that was a breeze. 

The place itself is great, very clean and minimalist. The main room is spacious and welcoming, and makes a great place to relax between meetings, excursions, and adventures in the city.  The bed is large and very comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen are both quite compact, but streamlined and functional. The kitchen essentials -- plates, cutlery, glasses -- are there in case you order delivery or bring takeout back. The WiFi was reliable and snappy, so no worries there. 

The neighborhood is lovely; you're situated right in the middle of a quieter side street between two bustling thoroughfares, so you can easily walk to dozens of smaller restaurants and a few notable ones, coffee shops, a bagel shop, convenience stores, and much more. I didn't end up using the subway at all on this trip because everything I needed was walkable, but I noted that I passed several subway entrances in my walks nearby, so you've definitely got easy access to a variety of lines.

This definitely goes into my ""good finds"" list in terms of Airbnb rentals. You won't regret it."
6452019,Midtown,"Patrick was very helpful and even though we arrived quite late, he arranged an easy pick of up the key. The apt is very central and easy walk to the subway. The roof top is also very nice to laze on a sunny day."
2479144,Midtown,"Location! Location! Location!!! Laz's apartment is AMAZING! You can not beat the location with all of the restaurants and bars close by and walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, the subway and great shopping! Laz was very accommodating as we arrived to JFK at 6am and were able to check in as soon as we arrived. The apartment I think is quite generous in size in comparison to most hotel rooms which you can pay big dollars for. Very well equipped, could do all our washing in the midst of our vacation. Laz had left fresh fruit and beautiful flowers for the 3 of us girls. He was very easy to contact and communicated very well with us before and during our stay. He made us feel very welcome and made us laugh a lot. Overall a great air bnb experience. Thanks Laz. "
13095358,Midtown,"As many others have said, the location is fantastic. Right near a Subway stop that had many of the subway lines connecting through it, and about a 10 minute walk to Penn Station. It made it convenient to get to most tourist spots and not too far to go back to if you want a break in the middle of the day. Perfect for a first time trip to New York City. Thanks, Kyle!"
1637178,Midtown,"I could recommend Mitch for an hour. Everything about the apartment, the location, the detailed notes about the apartment, Mitch's recommendations about local food/entertainment, just everything were amazing. Easily a 5 star review. The apartment is exactly as described and only 3 blocks away from Grand Central so it's a perfect ticket to get anywhere in the city quickly. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that the next time I'm heading to New York, I'll be checking to see if this spot is available. The location and niceness of the area for this price cannot be beat. Thank you for everything, Mitch!"
698094,Midtown,"Kristen was absolutely lovely and extremely helpful.  The private room is comfortable and surprisingly quiet.  The location is fantastic, located opposite MOMA and adjacent to 5th avenue, central park.  "
243352,Midtown,"Catherine was a very helpful considerate charming host.  Her midtown location is very convenient.  

I would suggest not planning on preparing meals in the apartment, there are a number of great places to eat in the City. The apartment is small and there isn't a lot of room to maneuver if you're doing your own meals. "
2561229,Midtown,"This apartment is in a great location, but I think it's important to get your expectations right when staying here. The apartment is a little old and is on the bottom floor of the apartment, which gets a bit of traffic, as well as having a hollow roof in which you can hear the person above stomping around when you're trying to get to sleep. Some of the amenities are old, we had a leaking tap and a light switch which was a bit dodgy, TV reception was a bit patchy. Whilst we didn't contact the owners to get it fixed whilst we stayed due to lack of time, I expect they would have fixed the issues pretty quickly. Fantastic location though, right in the heart of Manhattan. All in all, not a bad stay for the location, but amenities could be a bit better for the price point."
13466262,Midtown,Le logement était très bien situé au coeur de Manhattan. Nick nous a très bien accueilli et se souciait de notre confort pendant notre séjour. Il nous a aussi conseillé des endroits pour sortir le soir. Je vous le recommande !
8664721,Midtown,My girlfriend and I were visiting New York for the New Year's celebration. This was our first time using Airbnb and my expectations were exceeded. Evan set the standards very high - the room and services provided were extraordinary. Nice skyline view of the city from the apartment's living room. Friendly dog. Flexible check-in time. Great host. Highly recommended.
8860350,Midtown,We had a great stay here!  The apartment was as described and very spacious.  It is a pretty quiet area but also a short walk to everything we needed.  Our host was very nice and informative.  
6098253,Midtown,"Michaels apartment is very nice and in the perfect location. The bed is very comfortable and the air mattress is perfect too. Nothing but great things to say, Michael is a great host. "
144428,Midtown,"I enjoyed my stay at Brandon his apartment. It was clean and everything I needed was there. Towels, hair blower, cups and glasses etc. Very comfortable and in a great location with everything close by. His mom was very helpful with handing me the key, even though I was 30 minutes late because of the bad weather and traffic coming from the airport. I also asked if it was possible to have a late check out because of my late flight back and he let me know a day before that this was possible. Also the wireless worked fantastic. Overall Brandon responded very promptly to all my questions!"
4726448,Midtown,"love staying here, was clean and convient to my destination"
2595,Midtown,"Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!"
9731879,Midtown,"Sunny is a great host, oriented us to the apartment and surrounding area (where to get clothes washed, public transportation etc) and also fixed/followed up with any issues immediately (we had a problem with internet, due to the provider issues and fixed same day). My partner and I stayed in this unit for a month and a half for work/school. It was very comfortable for 2 people during our extended stay. This particular unit is on the highest floor- so expect a few flights of stairs: lugging groceries or tons of laundry can be a challenge but not definitely not impossible, the upside of the top floor- the ceilings are high making the apartment feel airy and open. Small bedroom that fit a double bed and plenty of closet space for 2. Because I'm short and prefer natural light, I usually fixed my hair/makeup in the bedroom with the larger full body mirror rather than the bathroom which can tight. All the apartment windows do face the street so you can also expect normal amount of city noise (I'm also from another major city so it didn't bother me). The apartment has a well vented, fully stocked (with all the essential pots/pans/dishes) small kitchenette with a minibar sized fridge. I found it was ample space to prepare meals. The kitchen counter also served as a dining table during meals and workspace during the day. The living room area also had a large coffee table for additional dining/working options. This was such a great location to live in- just a few steps away from subway stop and a leisurely walk to 5th ave shopping, central park or grand central stn. Starbucks on the same block, tons of restaurants and fun bars downstairs/nearby. There is a  whole foods grocery, post office, & gyms/spin studio all within few block radius and chain drugstores the next block over in either direction. Highly recommend for an extended stay."
14839848,Midtown,"Cole fue un excelente anfitrión, preocupado en cada momento de nuestras necesidades. El departamento es recomendable en todo momento, esta muy bien ubicado cercano a metros, lugares públicos, comercio, restoranes y bares. Tiene todo el equipamiento necesario y es muy reconfortable.

12570895,Midwood,"Marine's place was nice. All the housemates we interacted with were friendly and welcoming. The space was clean enough but nothing spectacular. Location is very close to the Q train, about 25-35 minutes into Manhattan."
4119763,Norwood,"The room was spacious, clean and the bed was excellent! Haythem was friendly and welcoming every time we had a question or wanted an opinion. Also, have to mention the Cat - really fun and extremely playful cat, he was lovely."
8772654,Morris Heights,"It is a really really a nice and cozy place to stay. 
The bedroom has everything there and Alba also offer microwave, food and nice water.
My friend and I really like this place.
The location also near metro and a lot of restaurants and stores around here.
It is very convenient for us to do anything.
Alba is a funny and nice woman.
I recommend this place to everybody!"

8663660,Maspeth,"Very safe area!! Clean and comfy bed, thoughtful host.
We didnt notice the check out time is 10PM, but the host was being generous and allowed us more time and also provided help with moving. 

Definitely a good value compare to others within the same cost."
53469,Middle Village,"Great place for a weekend getaway, especially if you plan to stay in/around Queens.  If you're looking to spend most of your time in Manhattan and plan to use public transportation, prepare for a 45-min to an hour commute; although this is much better than driving into the city and paying $$$ in tolls, which I learned the hard way (at least I had an EZ-Pass).

This basement apartment had all of the amenities I needed, and some I didn't even get to use (we ate out exclusively on our trip, so did not get to cook any means, however there is a range/oven in the unit).  Parking was plentiful in the neighborhood, which was great since we drove in from out of town.

Neighborhood was quiet (borderline too quiet if you're used to city living) and we felt safe walking around at night.  Shops and more are just a 10 minute drive.

I did not get to meet Mark in person, but he was very responsive to my emails and answered all of my questions promptly.  I would definitely recommend Mark's place for future trips to Queens/NYC!"
1649957,Morningside Heights,"I stayed in the Olu's home for a week with a friend . It was a beautiful experience. The apartment is beautiful and clean. The bathroom is spacious ad fully furnished. It's on the main street of Harlem so I didn't have to walk far to restaurants, the subway, groceriestores etc. Despite being on the fifth floor without a lift, I would stay again in this apartment .

255487,Morningside Heights,"My son has just joined Columbia University.  I was in New York for a few days with him as he looked for a place to lease and settle down for his stint in NY. Niv's place was extremely attractive due to the proximity to Columbia University.  What made the stay special was Niv's genuine desire to make our stay extremely comfortable. The apartment was clean,   bright and ventilated, had an outstanding location and was ultra comfortable. My days with my son were special and the completely hassle free stay,  thanks to Niv, helped me focus on his settling down. I rate the stay 5 star and strongly recommend.

538012,Morningside Heights,Gabriela was very welcoming and accommodating without being overbearing. The apartment was very nice and much better than I expected. She had everything prepared including air conditioning and wifi. The room was private and spacious. The apartment is located in a really great neighborhood. I highly recommend staying here especially if you are travelling alone. 
165461,Morningside Heights,Mr. and Mrs. Bedi were great hosts! I stayed with them while I was waiting for my lease to start and they made me feel at home. Columbia is right down the street and it's close to several subway lines.

1788989,Nolita,"Wonderful large spacious apartment, fabulous accommodating hosts and great location.

Stayed for a week in august, location is perfect, close to a couple of subway stations, prince Street (direct to Coney island) and Broadway Lafayette, we got everywhere we needed to from these two stations. 

Neighbourhood is really nice, definitely has a village feel to it, nice restaurant at the end of the block (turn left as you come out of apartment building) (URL HIDDEN) I also wanted to try cafe Havana on corner of prince and Elizabeth, sadly it was always too busy to get a table.

Lots of boutique shops nearby, and by Broadway Lafayette station the larger high street shops. There is a wholefoods 5 min walk away and a trader Joe's about 30 mins walk. 

Bed is massive and comfy, apartment is beautiful large but cosy, shower is great, overall a great apartment and a great stay.

Tanja kept in communication throughout the stay, answering any questions I had. I would absolutely recommend to stay here. 

Thank you tanja for our stay "
1185644,Nolita,"Fantastic location in the heart of Nolita, close to Little Italy and Chinatown and so many great restaurants, bars and boutiques. An easy walk to the Spring St subway.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1066779,Nolita,"The apartment was clean, spacious and in an amazing location. Arne was very flexible and I had no problems checking in/out. Thanks!"
4932139,Nolita,"This is a lovely apartment in a great neighborhood. Stacey is a wonderful host and very responsive. The neighborhood offers an ideal location with great restaurants, shops and bars all within steps of the front door! Several easy subway options within several blocks and added pluses like the Angelika movie theater and an organic dry cleaner are all close by. Wholefoods is an easy walk too! 
The apartment is well maintained and offers all the basics. Stacey was very lovely to correspond with and always answered promptly. Her son lives in the building and is available for any issues. 
I couldn't have asked for more! We loved staying there! "
3979194,Nolita,"The apartment is tiny but functional and has everything one needs when travelling. Communication with the host was quick and easy and we found the apartment exactly as described. What we loved most was the location in central Nolito, minutes away from Soho. We really enjoyed exploring the immediate surroundings of the apartment by foot and took subway (several stations minutes away) to places further away. Recommended!
"
17285548,Nolita,"Totally loved this place! There is no better area to be in NYC than Soho, there are so many restaurants, bars, stores and so on next to the apartment. My friends and I had a great experience here and would recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy the city. Very clean and well equipped. We'll come back!"
3494876,Nolita,"We had a lovely stay in Adam's Nolita apartment for a long weekend. It is in an awesome location, a vibrant and nice area close to subway and right by Little Italy. The apartment itself was tidily presented and organized, and we found it to be a quiet and comfortable base from which to explore the city. There are a few flights of stairs to get up - no worries at all for us with Backpacks for luggage, but may be a bit more of a challenge with bulky suitcases. Adam was prompt and friendly in all his communications and made our first Airbnb experience nice and easy (I did misinterpret his instructions for the key collection, but that was my mistake). Thanks for hosting us Adam!!! Would happily stay again if in NYC another time."
515408,Nolita,"Arne's apartment was fantastic. Perfect location, close to great cafes, restaurants and shops all within a couple of blocks. The 6 subway is a minute away and the BDFM and NR stations are within a few minutes also. The apartment is as described, it is small, but ok for my husband and I as we weren't there much and the location is key. We've stayed further south in LES before and this apartment and location was much better. Arne was a great host, the apartment was clean and wifi was excellent. Would definitely recommend this apartment! Thanks Arne!"
15249079,Nolita,Nice cozy place!
788035,Nolita,"I had the best stay at Luis' apartment. I was there for a month and felt right at home my entire stay. This place can't be in a better location. Right next to shops, bars, cafes and shopping. The room has a very comfy bed, good closet space and great natural light. The apartment is super clean and Luis is an amazing host. I would definietly stay here again."
10120206,Nolita,The location was great. When I arrived they were not ready for my arrival so they upgraded me to a slightly bigger room which was nice. The rooms are small and the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling  but for the price it was great and it had everything I needed. The staff was helpful and nice and I had a great time.
4050254,Park Slope,"We had a great experience with Emily--our first on airbnb. Entry to the home was just as described and the house is lovely. Bath very bright, clean and modern. Emily was very welcoming and her pet dog was friendly and under control. Great access to Prospect Park and the Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn museum. We ate well on 7th Avenue and Emily's recommendations were spot on. Thanks for a lovely visit. "
10068386,Park Slope,"Ying Ying and her partner are exceptionally lovely hosts. Everything was like on the pictures and even better. We stayed ten nights and were offered additional fresh towels and sheets. We were delighted to find such a clean, environmentally conscious and calm place in New York. Thank you Ying Ying for all your great tips and chocolates too! "
2897100,Park Slope,"We really enjoyed out stay at Karen's. She is a wonderful host and we would def come back to stay there again! 

The room was super nice; we enjoyed having wifi and AC! 

The neighborhood was really cosy and close to the subway that made it easy to get around. It was just what we needed for our stay in NYC. 

We can most def recommend Karen's place at any time! "
1026702,Park Slope,"I recently spent 10 days staying in Miriam's apartment and it was perfect! The location is fantastic, lots of places to eat near by and only a short walk to the subway to get into Manhattan. As a girl staying on her own I felt very safe and it was also reassuring knowing that Miriam was so close by if I had any problems. 

The apartment is lovely and cosy (it was on average -5 degrees celcius the week I was there and the apartment was lovely and warm!) The apartment is exactly as pictured and the bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! The apartment truly was a home away from home. I was so sad to leave!

Miriam was an excellent host and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in NYC/Brooklyn.  I will most definitely be staying there again the next time I'm in NYC!"
412092,Park Slope,"We had a lovely stay at Tess and Sean's apartment in March 2014.  We picked it based on the location and the many positive reviews, and were pleased to find that everything was as advertised.  The apartment is in a great location - close to more than one subway line, a few blocks from Prospect Park, and right in the heart of Park Slope.  It was very clean and bright.  Though the bedroom faces the street, we had no trouble sleeping - their block really quiets down after hours.  Bed was comfortable and shower had good water pressure.  They also provided us with clean towels for our stay.  Coordinating with Tess was really easy and she was very responsive to questions.  They were great hosts.  Definitely recommended! "
3601743,Park Slope,"My friends and I had a terrific time staying in Richard and his family's home. The floor we stayed on was immaculate, with such excellent artwork and woodwork throughout. We had everything we needed for our three night stay from the moment we walked in, but knew that if we needed anything we could ask Richard. The home is in an extremely safe, quiet and quaint neighborhood that is roughly 10 minutes away from the subway that took us around to everywhere we wanted to go. It was very convenient.
For most of our trip we were only there during sleeping hours so we didn't see much of Richard and George during our stay. We are glad we at least got to meet them for they are extraordinarily nice people. Of course, we had the pleasure of being around Peaches the cat as well, who was a lovely guest to have. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend this home to anyone coming to stay in New York. Such an elegant and safe home from very kind people at a very reasonable price. 5 stars indeed!!!"
2336995,Park Slope,After spending time at more than a few airbnb places I must say that Louise is the best host by far! She's interested without being intrusive and while it is her house she'll make you feel at home right away. I definitely plan on coming back to Louise's place when I'm back in New York!
258397,Park Slope,"(English review will follow) Vivre dans l’appartement d’Annie correspond en tout point avec ce qu’elle propose sur sa page. C’est même encore mieux! J’ai eu le plaisir d’y vivre pendant huit semaines. Que vous soyez seul ou avec votre famille, l’appartement convient parfaitement à toutes les possibilités. La chambre est grande et le lit très confortable. Le divan peut aussi servir de divan-lit. Pour ceux qui font un séjour prolongé, il est possible de cuisiner tout ce que l’on veut. C’est un appartement lumineux, grand et très propre et la connexion Wi-Fi fonctionne parfaitement.  Annie est une hôte discrète, dévouée et à l’écoute des locataires. Park Slope est un quartier extraordinaire et regorge de bons cafés et de restaurants variés. Il est simple et rapide de se rendre à Manhattan par métro. La proximité de Prospect Park est aussi un attrait très intéressant. Je retournerai assurément à cet appartement et je le recommande sans réserve.

Live in Annie's apartment corresponds completely with what she proposes on her airbnb page. It is better even still! I had the pleasure to live there during eight full weeks. Whether you are alone or with your family, the apartment suits perfectly in all the possibilities. The room is big and the bed is very comfortable. The sofa can also serve as sofa-bed. For those who make a prolonged stay, it is possible to cook everything that you want. It is a bright, big and very clean apartment and the Wi-Fi connection works perfectly. Annie is a discreet host, devoted and tuned to the tenants. Park Slope is a great neighborhood and abounds good cafés and varied restaurants. It is simple and fast to go to Manhattan by subway. Prospect Park's closeness is also very interesting attraction. I shall return undoubtedly to this apartment and I recommend it without reserve.
"
389050,Park Slope,"Although we arrived earlier than the check-in time (we had a seven hour drive) Heather was very gracious allowing us to drop off our luggage before parking our vehicle for the weekend and heading out to sight see.   My family of six (including three very tall sons) was a tight fit, but they all enjoyed the New York experience.   It was close to our wedding venue (the reason we were visiting the city) so we could walk to and from the wedding.  It was also close to the subway system so travel to Manhattan was easy."
1886348,Park Slope,Great place in a great neighborhood. Apartment was a great place to hang out in-between dinner with friends and outings into the city.
417685,Park Slope,The host canceled this reservation 185 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2495241,Park Slope,"I the first time reserved housing through Airbnb and I had some experiences about it, but everything was remarkable! The first there came my son Daniil who is 17 years old. Louise couldn't be at the time of his arrival of the house, but has written to us as to Daniil to get to the house. Louise very much worried that Daniil had no problems and she always was in touch. The house remarkable and we felt very comfortably. Still it is necessary to tell about a remarkable dog! This is a surprising dog. Thanks a lot of Louise. Surely once again we will stop at you!"
8916960,Park Slope,"We really appreciated our stay at Patrick's and I would definitely recommend this accomodation to friends visiting New York.
The place is as described. Really clean. Easy to find. And in a nice neighborghood.
It's at walking distance from the subway and it's nice to get back to a more quietly place after exploring Manhattan.
Patrick and his wife were very responding, easy to get in touch woth while really respectful of our privacy."
9859861,Park Slope,"We had an absolutely perfect stay. The place and location were fantastic. The apartment was immaculate, and was light and bright with plenty of room, including a lot of closet space. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with many useful items. It was a great ""home away from home.""

The location was perfect; near the subway station with many great restaurants and cafes nearby. The place was surprisingly quiet for such a convenient location. Johanna's guidebook was a wonderful help. We loved all of the places she recommended. Johanna was warm, welcoming, and helpful whenever we encountered her. We hope to stay there again if we return to Brooklyn."
24281,Park Slope,Very clean room and bathroom in a great neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again!
64376,Parkchester,Dexter is great!!!! He really goes out is way to ensure his guest are comfortable. From beginning to end he was there to provide answers to questions about the areas and where stores and even the closest barber shop. I had a fantastic time.
1222563,Queens Village,"Yolanda provided me exactly what I needed for my short business trip to New York. 
She responded really at the last minute, was incredibly welcoming and helpful.
The checking process was incredibly smooth, and everything was working well instantly.
The place was super clean, and the welcome explanations and everything were very clear and very professional.
The place was close enough to the airport that I could arrive in a short time, and leave fast as well. The neighborhood is very quiet too.
Overall, it was really a great luck for me, and I am very grateful to Yolanda."
2814931,Port Morris,"Caroline's loft was just as advertised: bright, clean, and spacious. A quiet building with a convenient laundry on the same floor and a gym just below--and only three blocks to the subway--made for a charming week in NY. Thanks, Caroline. "
4150932,Prospect Heights,"Morgan's great communication made for a fantastic experience! The room is clean, quiet, and comfortable. The bathroom is pristine. The neighborhood is awesome!"
1137587,Prospect Heights,"My family; 2 adults, 2 teenager spent a wonderful 5 days at Jenny's peaceful Brooklyn flat, the flat didn't disappoint. The furnishings were not only beautiful but comfy and practical. With lovely touches such as a tray of Burts shampoos and conditioners in the bathroom. Jenny was really helpful settling us in, directing us to the supermarkets, laundry and car service and lending me an iron. The flat is well located just away from the main bustle of Brooklyn, but close enough to the subway and a 20 minute direct trip to Time Square. There's an eclectic mix of hip and old school restaurants within a 10 minute walk along Flatbush avenue. For five days we felt like we were living in Brooklyn, and very lucky to be there. I highly recommend Jenny's apartment. "
956573,Prospect Heights,"Mitty's place is beautiful, clean, and *spitting* distance to an excellent subway stop.  He is kind, accommodating, and gives guests the respect of ensuring that they understand the house rules so that everyone (you included!) has a positive experience.  especially as a woman traveling alone with social obligations in the evening (going to the theater, to meet with old friends in manhattan, to a wedding, etc.), I could not have asked for a better place to stay.  thank you so much, Mitty!"
7688130,Prospect Heights,Tania and Len's place is great. Len(Tania's cousin) did a wonderful job welcoming me into his home and making sure I was comfortably situated. The place and neighborhood are amazing.
7979237,Prospect Heights,"This is our second time staying with Len. This time we were in the back bedroom that leads to the back garden. It was perfect for us since we had our Boston Terrier with us. While the room is smaller than the front room we had previously stayed in, I would to book it again. The bed is very comfy!

Len is a great host. Since we've lived in Brooklyn for years, we didn't need his expertise on the area, but it's fun to chat with him. "
1631938,Prospect Heights,Seemas place has a very nice location in Brooklyn! It is close to a lot of (excellent) restaurants and has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. We also love the fact that it is so easy to go to Manhattan. Everything in the apartment is as described and the communication with Seema was fast and easy. 
188661,Prospect Heights,The reservation was canceled 47 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6277217,Prospect Heights,Jordan's apartment is spacious and well equipped and located in a quiet street of brownstones in a desirable part of Brooklyn.  We were close to a number of subway options for easy access to Manhattan sightseeing. Jordan was very responsive to all out requests and made our arrival hassle free. Nice to enjoy a glass of wine on our arrival as well. Would highly recommend this apartment.
15944,Prospect Heights,"Of course it would be nice if your weather could be as great as our was in late September: mostly sunny, days mid seventies, nights cooled by a light fall breeze, but I don’t think even Jacki can arrange for that. She takes care of everything else, though. We did a lot of cooking-to-go for the family of the new grandbaby we were visiting in the nicely equipped kitchen. Some days we just wanted to hang around the apartment it was so comfortable and interesting. Outside, a fine neighborhood with plenty of retail and dining on Vanderbilt and Flatbush, and beautiful residences on the cross streets. One long and one short block to the mighty Q train that runs all the time and takes you anywhere you want to go. When we got home late we’d sit out on the front steps feeling completely safe and watch the wonderful diversity of Brooklyn go by – high entertainment for a couple of mid-westerners. Need I mention it’s about half the price of a bargain (New York City variety) hotel room?"
1183172,Prospect Heights,"ZACH ha sido muy amable y servicial, resolviendo incluso asuntos que no le eran obligatorios como nuestro súper early arrival y una entrega de Amazon. Siempre estuvo a la órden pero jamás invadió nuestro espacio; de hecho solo nos lo cruzamos una vez.
EL APARTAMENTO es tal cual publicado; lo único que no puede verse en la publicación es lo silencioso que es, a la hora de dormir no se escucha un sonido!. Un placer... 
EL BARRIO se siente seguro a toda hora (supimos llegar entrada la madrugada sin inconveniente), es muy tranquilo y a la vuelta del apartamento hay supermercado, algunos restaurantes y la parada del bus.
EL TRANSPORTE básico es el bus no. 45, que es el que lleva al Barcley's Center, de donde salen la mayoría de la líneas de subte. El recorrido desde el apartamento hasta el Barcley's Center dura entre 10 y 15min., y el bus pasa cada 10min. aprox. (chequear horarios con anticipación porque hay varias horas de la madrugada en el que no hay servicio). Luego en subte hasta Manhattan hay otros 20min. como mínimo, dependiendo de a qué parte se vaya. La línea C que no pasa por Barcley's Center se puede conectar tomando un tren que pasa a algunas cuadras del apartamento.
Gracias Zach :-)
"
10251082,Prospect Heights,"This apartment is amazing and Polina is a fantastic host. There were six of us staying here, all adults, and there was more than enough space for all of us to fit comfortably. 

It is exactly as it looks in the pictures, if not bigger, and it's beautifully done. We will definitely stay here again and we'd recommend to any of our friends and family visiting Manhattan or Brooklyn. 

Genuinely couldn't say a bad word about this place. "
4410626,Red Hook,"I was able to communicate with Nick via Airbnb app, received quick reply, and made a reservation without any hassle. The picture here is pretty accurate, very clean. The house is a walking distance to Fairway market, which was a plus. Thank you Nick!
"
8741053,Red Hook,"This place makes a good base whilst exploring New York. The studio itself was clean and comfortable, and I was pleased for the fridge to store water as it was so hot outside!! (air con was also a blessing, especially as the studio has no windows). As the studio is in the basement there is quite a steep, narrow staircase leading down to the door so you just need to be careful whilst carrying heavy cases. Inside, it has everything you need, although it would have been nice to have two mugs instead of sharing the one! The bed was very comfortable and a decent size, and the bathroom was modern and spotless. In terms of the area, we didn't explore Red Hook, but I would recommend checking out the restaurants near Carroll Gardens subway (10 minute walk & your nearest subway) and if you don't mind a 20/25 minute walk, head up Henry Street towards Brooklyn Heights for some really cool bars and places to eat with great views over lower Manhattan!! We arrived late-ish so weren't greeted, but Ed messaged to make sure we had arrived safely which was nice. I always found Ed to be very responsive which was great. Lastly, it would have been beneficial to have been told what time we needed to checkout early on as we got a bit of a last minute surprise! So where check out time says 'flexible' just make sure a time is agreed. All in all, this place is a clean, comfortable and affordable place to stay (which is all you really need with all the exploring!!) I would recommend! "
10983426,Rego Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed out stay at Giuseppa's apartment. She such a warm and welcoming host. The apartment is great and located in a residential neighborhood right off the main drag (Woodhaven Blvd). For those traveling with kids, you should know that the listing is 2-3 blocks away from a fantastic playground. We were excited to make this discovery as was our daughter who was probably bored with us! The apartment provided ample room for our family of 2+ and there is definitely plenty of street parking unlike other neighborhoods. It's simply decorated and comfortable - felt like a home. :-) Giuseppa was responsive to our questions but also gave us the privacy that we are accustomed to. A heads up if you're traveling with small children, the apartment is heated via radiators which is typical for houses built at the time and we weren't surprised at all. Just something to keep in mind. The listing indicates that it's not suitable for young children but we found it to be fine, just need to be aware of the front door as it leads directly to the stairs. We would definitely stay here again and are so glad to have met Giuseppa. Thank you!"
4537297,Rego Park,"Eddie is a kind and thoughtful host. During my two day stay, he was very mindful of my privacy, yet helped me when I needed. His place is located in a convenient place - a few blocks away from Mall, main streets, bus stations, metro station, etc, but his neighbourhood is amazingly quiet. I couldn’t believe that it was in the middle of New York! Clean place with a comfortable bed, a reliable host, and a very reasonable price. What's more you can ask for?! I will strongly recommend his place to stay.

エディーさんは親切で素晴らしいホストです。日本的な繊細さを持っていてとても良く気が付き、手助けが欲しいときは自然にスッと手を差し伸べてくれるタイプの人です。清潔好きでウォッシャー・トイレを設置していることも日本人には見逃せません。日本を旅した時によい経験をしてきたようで、また武道を稽古していることからも、会話が弾みました。しかし、プライバシーにはとても気を使ってくれました。エディーさんのところは場所的にも静かな住宅街にあるのですが、モールやバス停、駅、レストランにも歩いて数分のところにあり、非常に便利です。ニューヨークのど真ん中で、手ごろな値段でこれほどの場所は他にあるでしょうか。エディーさんのところをお勧めします。"
7670562,Richmond Hill,"Gurpreet's place is nice and at a truly affordable price.
The bed is very comfortable, and the amenities makes staying there feel hotel-like with an added warmth that only a true host can give.
I had a nice time while I stayed at Gurpreet's place. The neighborhood is pretty safe and the people are very friendly. Even though you have to take a bus, to get to the subway, it's only a less than 10 minutes ride, to either direction, the bus stops are only a block away.
I'd recommend Gurpreet's place to anyone."
2136293,Richmond Hill,Really nice and cozy place. Not far from JFK and LaGuardia. Just over 5km (4miles). Friendly people and quiet neighbourhood. Close to E and J lines(10min walk). The E line is the express line to Manhattan. Definitely ok.
7148721,Ridgewood,Had a great time at MJ's with him and his family. 
14355535,Ridgewood,really unpleasant experience..
7802362,Ridgewood,"This is an awesome place to stay and Nerissa is great. She always answers questions and the room was immaculate. Location is right near the subway, and there are some cool restaurants nearby. I would strongly recommend this to anyone (except Nerissa, because she already lives there). "
620181,Ridgewood,"Ian's place is wonderful. Neat, clean and airy. Very comfortable. It's a short walk to the train into the city. A longish ride (30 minutes to Midtown), but there are always seats. The neighborhood is interesting-- a real look at the real New York. Clean, safe, quiet. A lot of eating and shopping options. You'll have to go to Williamsburg or Manhattan if you're looking for a party or fine dining scene."
442636,Ridgewood,"Was very pleased with our stay. It's private, spacious, and well maintained. Joris was very accommodating and flexible. Highly recommend this flat and will definitely be staying here again."
716949,Ridgewood,"Ian and Jose were great.  I didn't get to meet Ian, due to his very dedicated and busy work schedule and my long hours out.  But I can say that he's great because he was super flexible and accommodating for very last minute and wonky travel plans on my part.  I immediately felt welcome at our first exchange and nothing differed throughout my stay.  I had some good and like-minded chatting time with Jose who was my primary contact in the apartment and is super personable and congenial and knowledgeable about neighborhoods as well as local real estate.  They have a elusive, yet friendly cat, a super SPOTLESS apartment (especially the bathroom), and an incredibly comfortable bed.  The apartment was inviting and cozy and toasty warm in winter (can't speak for AC summer).  I felt like I had more than adequate privacy given the other bedroom was at the front of the apartment, and I was in the back, not to mention that the bathroom was right outside my bedroom door.  Ridgewood Queens is a culturally diverse neighborhood with eateries and conveniences that borders Bushwick, a neighborhood in transition in Brooklyn.  The apartment  has access to two subway lines: the M at Seneca Ave 2 blocks away which takes you into SoHo and connecting areas, and the L (the 14th street line) 5-6 blocks away at Myrtle Ave (also reachable by an M connection) which takes you to Union Square and connecting areas.   {Because I know BK, I chose to avoid the at L stop at night but felt safe everywhere else.}  Both journeys take about 30 minutes into Manhattan.  Overall Ian and Jose have a nice apartment and provided a nice stay, I would come back in a heart beat.  Thanx Guys!"
14502728,Ridgewood,The arrangements provided are not consistent and if there is a problem the host is unreachable.  The property has an array of different guests which is fine but if there is a mess or disturbance it is not handled until much later or not at all. The sheets I had in my room had hair and stains...the bathroom door does not lock and the showers were left unclean by other visitors.
7602785,Ridgewood,"Bacilio is really kind. Place is really nice. Neighbourhood is quiet. Metro/subway is next to the apt, you can get really fast to Manhattan with it.

We were there to visit NYC, we didn't stay a lot in the apt but we are really happy with our experience.

We recommend it ! "
1740412,Riverdale,"Abby's apartment was a wonderful place for me to stay!  Abby and her daughter are both very friendly and giving people.   They're happy to chat with you, but they are also respectful of privacy. They were very considerate in making sure I had everything I needed - I felt very welcome and safe in their home.  The apartment is very clean and the room is comfortable.  I was given access to the kitchen, which was was great for breakfast and some dinners. They have two incredibly friendly cats, who stay out of the guest room for the sake of allergies, but who are more than happy to play if you're not allergic. The location may seem a bit far to some people, but Riverdale is a great area to stay in.  It's much quieter than being downtown, and it's really easy to get downtown via the 1 train.  Abby's apartment is a couple steps away from Johnson Ave, which has some restaurants and other things right around the corner.  "
13752309,Rockaway Beach,"Absolutely loved the bungalow! The house was perfect for the weekend trip.  The entire place was so cute and homey. The bungalow was at the back of the property, so very private.  There was tons of sunlight and space  the bungalow was fully stocked with cooking needs, and the beds were so comfy. Beth was an amazing host; being kind enough to take time from her day to work on the wifi- which was the only slight issue we had, but it's technology, and we weren't too concerned.  I would recommend and definitely visit again.  "
7093920,Roosevelt Island,"Svetlana is an amazing host! The apartment is exactly what it looks like in the pictures and is spotless and squeaky clean. Svetlana made me feel extremely welcome and was very accommodating. My bus arrived late to New York and after notifying Svetlana, she said she had no problem with me getting late to her home and once I did, she was downstairs waiting for for me and made sure I got there alright! 

She helped me out with getting around New York and helped me figure out the subway and the tram system. I felt extremely welcomed.

Svetlana's beautiful artistic home is the perfect place to stay in NYC and when I go back, I am definitely going back to Svetlana's! "
1174944,SoHo,"Jorges apartment was perfect for us! Cool neighbourhood with lots of fancy shops, bars and deli´s - far away from the loud, bustling, ""touristic"" NY but near enough to walk to most of the NY-hotspots! We slept superbly in the cosy bed, the door to the terrace even wide open, and enjoyed  by night the lights and smell of that wonderfull city! Although we haven´t met Jorge before he welcomed us like ""old friends"" and was very helpful! The apt. is small but has everything (WiFi, TV, microwave, even a dishwasher we never used;) you need for a perfect stay! Thanks a lot Jorge!"
6227980,SoHo,"Kamrouz is a very welcoming host, the room is great and the location couldn't be any better. Soho, Little Italy, Nolita and Chinatown right at your doorstep with lots of nice cafés, restaurants and shops. "
754190,SoHo,"Swetha's appartement has a very great location in the heart of Soho and is very close to Nolita, East And Greenwich Villages. Main shops, restaurants, cafes and the subway stations are very close from Swetha's home,  which is very nice and convenient. The Soho area is great and trendy. The appartment is big, in a walk-up building at the 2. Floor. The room is OK and the Bed is tlarge. Nevertheless, there were  some inconvénients for me : my room was not quiet due to the noises I could hear from the street and the subway noises woke me up every morning. Also, I could not close my room to keep my things safe. Swetha wanted to solve that problem but could not achieve it because she was abroad during my stay, so our communication was only by email, but it was fine and Swetha was available and tried to be helpful. In conclusion, I can imagine there are worst and better places than Swetha's, so for me it was OK."
5422535,SoHo,"Stephanie was a joy of a host. She is very responsive and super nice. 
The apartment is incredible. The photos are gorgeous yet barely do it justice. It is impeccably decorated and in an incredible locations. You cannot go wrong!! "
4301454,SoHo,"Shannon was an amazing host, she was easy to get in touch with when needed and her flat in the city was wonderful!! The location was perfect and close to everything. Could not have asked for a better place to stay in the city!"
2096641,SoHo,"The place: The location is ideal. Blocks away from Little Italy, SoHo, Chinatown. It is only 1 flight of stairs up! This is important if you carry heavy luggage, like me. The actual space is beautiful - open space, clean simplistic design, extremely spacious, all amenities available. 
The host: Nick takes hosting to the next level! He made sure we had all we needed for our NY stay. He even brought over cheescake because the trip was in celebration of my mom's birthday - won us over! We had an issue with the TV and he was there the next day with the cable guy. Nick really made the trip extra special! Cant wait to be back Nick :) "
4766582,SoHo,"Great place in every way, would highly recommend!"
3712681,SoHo,"The location of Tej's apt is amazing. It looked just as the images show. It's not huge, but it was accommodating for our family of 3. It was certainly worth the stay. "
2432078,SoHo,The reservation was canceled 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
405408,SoHo,"Our first AirBNB experience was at the SOHO Loft. Everything was described accurately, and we feel that the Loft itself was the centerpiece of our NYC stay for a long weekend.

The loft is just as beautiful as the photo, and the hosts went beyond the call of duty in making us feel welcome, and handling our questions and requests with hospitality and grace.

We are already talking about our next trip to NYC, and would probably not stay anywhere else but this truly special space. 

I also have to mention the location - it is really just a block or two from anywhere you want to walk in SOHO. But is is also on a quiet side-street, a bit hidden away."
15165678,SoHo,"The apartment was in a great location and was generally comfortable to stay at. However, the host was rather contentious and did not vacate the apartment upon our arrival. This made the overall visit a little uncomfortable. "
15141364,Rosedale,Christine and her husband were accommodating and helpful. As soon as I walked in he carried my suitcase to the room and she made me tea. All of my needs were met and I slept well. The location is close to JFK which was perfect for my layover. 
8664965,Sheepshead Bay,"this was a nice experience, Nora is really friendly and everything was perfect, I felt comfortable in her home , and was exactly that I expected! thanks for everything  Nora! I hope see you again !"
14673672,Sheepshead Bay,"Отличные апартаменты, гостеприимный хозяин, чисто, уютно, удобно добираться до пляжа. Хороший дом, недалеко от метро. Если поеду в Нью-Йорк обязательно там остановлюсь еще раз."
5287733,South Ozone Park,"Fantastic stay, Dr. Sally is very personable and helpful. The location is a short walk from the A train that goes all over NYC. We even felt safe walking back at 3am from a night on the town. Rockaway Beach is a short trip the other way on the A too. If you are staying in New York make sure you consider this spot. Nice private location!"
915020,South Slope,"Thanks  to Roselyn and Rodney  who are very kind and welcoming 
The appartment is charming , very comfortable ; it is quiet and convenient ; the bed is perfect and the bathroom so pretty 
Its location in Brooklyn is perfect ( restaurants  , shops and quiet street and neighborood )
Excellent holidays 
Highly recommend
"
168123,South Slope,"We had a great stay at Sara' s place. Everything was taken care of before our arrival and Sara made sure everything went well even if she was not here to welcome us. The neighbourhood is great, one would really miss out on not walking around, and the place perfect to accommodate a long-ish stay. It's very quiet, clean, close to nice shops and cafes but as well a great base to go through Manhattan and Brooklyn through the F and G lines. 
"
76761,South Slope,"this was my first experience with airbnb .. and a great one
Evelyn was very welcoming. she gave us good advices on restaurants in the neighbourhood and when we arrived there was in the fridge all you need for breakfast
the flat is nice and clean"
3623946,South Slope,"I stayed at Valerie's & Patricia's place for 10 days. Mine was a special situation since I went to NY for working & I needed a place until I could find something. Valerie was really helpful before I arrived: she recommended me banks, areas to live in...
And during my time at the house Patricia was GREAT! She was the one who really helped me with everything & we had a great time together going to the beach & to Prospect Park. 
The Subway is really close as well as the park. 
I strongly recommend the place to everybody"
4956293,South Slope,Everything was just as described. We had an easy time finding this place and getting settled. Nick's great notes about the neighborhood were really helpful! The neighborhood was so great and it was fun to explore the different bars and restaurants. 
5364134,South Slope,"Ashley was a really friendly host, making sure that when we arrived someone would welcome us right away as she could not be at home at that time. Our room and other rooms of the house were very welcoming, clean and tidy. The area where is located also offers several solutions for meals all within walking distance.
We really enjoyed our time."
10053934,South Slope,The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9707498,South Slope,"Dear Viviana & Fred: The location to Goldenfest was GREAT, a short 4 block walk.The checkin was smooth, key access was as explained. The layout of the place was suitable for me. The amenities were a nice touch. No noisy neighbors was a plus since I got in at 1 AM Saturday and 3 AM Sunday- needed the extended quiet. A short walk to the train to Manhattan for the Sunday nightclub event. The 4 keys required to access the unit were a little daunting but by Monday morning I was getting the hang of it. The Internet access was excellent and the local TV channels were good for old school entertainment. Al in al I would stay here again if/when Goldenfest returns to Grand Prospect Hall next year."
10628601,South Slope,"We had a great stay at Aran's! She was very accommodating, as we arrived late from the airport. The room was as pictured, set up nicely and clean. The bed was comfortable with aircon in our room. Even though our room was on the street, it's very quiet at night. The neighbourhood is great with lots of families and restaurants and the park nearby. We would definitely come back! Thank you!"
1342296,South Slope,"Staying at Ana's airbnb was fantastic. She and her daughter are nice people. I felt at home there. They were great to talk to. The room was very comfortable and I slept like a baby.I also had access to the kitchen, sitting room and bathroom. She works at MOma which is the Museum of Modern Art. She provided me with a free pass for 2 to go there. She is highly rated."
4081926,Springfield Gardens,We had a great experience staying at this house which is a separate apartment from the main house.  It was clean and the bed was extra comfortable.  Jennifer went out of her way by guiding us to the Subway so we could get to Times Square for New Years.  Their flexible check in and out time was a huge plus.  Their place is ideal as you can access all of New York City from this Queens neighborhood.  Extra bonus for me was being 5 minutes from Farmers and Linden Blvds which fans of old school Hip Hop will recognize.  I would definitely stay here again next time I want to spend time in New York.
6100694,Spuyten Duyvil,The arrangements were exactly as requested and expected.  The comfort and privacy were complete.  The location for my wife and me was ideal.  
8784461,St. Albans,"Très bon séjour, Chris est très gentil et d'une grande aide. Merci pour tout !"
62787,Tompkinsville,"Hi,the first thing thing to say if there are curtains but there aren't blinds so you'll wake up at 5 in the morning with the sunlight.The house was very comunicated  but the bus to the Ferry takes more than 10 minutes so if you don't want to walk to the Ferry that it takes 25 minutes. you have to considérate this because there is a Ferry each 30 minutes.The Ferry is free but is has one stop at the south of Manhattan so if you want to explore the city you are fórced to take the metro card that it Costs 32 dóllars per week.The room and the bathroom were clean but The room has ants due to the cracks of the floor and the last 2 days there weren't more toilet paper left.The kitchen and the door of the house has a code so it they don't change often someone in the neighborhood can sleep 2 nights and get the code so you arent 100% safe because you don't know how the neighborhood is. About Jay,he didn't receive us the first day and the whole stay so he didn't transmit us confidence.He didn't answered to our questions by whatssap before arriving to the city although he read it..."
4244685,Tompkinsville,We had a warm welcome on Staten Island. 
7905098,St. George,"Victor and Clara are great hosts! The room is nice and clean, with a comfy bed. They're very accessible and helpful as well. The location is a quick walk from the ferry, and it's a nice way to get a free look at the Statue of Liberty every day. Recommended for a nice trip to see the city without breaking the bank! "
2889387,St. George,"I stayed at Rob and Elle's only one night. However, it was a delightful stay. Lovely home, spacious and inmaculate clean place, so nicely appointed and comfortable I would be happy to live there! I felt at home. Easy free commute to Manhattan on the ferry, which is just a short walk away. As for the hosts, they are the real premium on this place, fantastic couple, extremely kind and helpful. As other reviews mention, they go the extra mile to ensure a perfect stay for their guests. This place is a real gem all around. Highly recommended!
 
 "
3858386,Stuyvesant Town,"My godchild  and I spent 5 days in Jason's apartment. He was a great host for us and the apartment is fantastic. It is exactly as seen in the photos and listed in the description. The two rooms are separated from each other and in the small kitchen there is everything you need. The rooms and the bathroom were very clean.There was a special charm through the many small unusal details.
Already during registration Jason responded each time very quickly to any questions or requests we had. He met us at the apartment and gave us tips regarding his favorite neighberhood spots. We could also use his Internet access during our stay.
The location is very convenient, in a safe and quiet area. Several bus lines are only one block away and also the Metro is near by.
For someone who is looking for a slightly unusual property, I can recommend Jason's apartment.
Thank you Jason for the great time."
263776,Sunnyside,"Joanne's place is a gem and Joanne is an amazing host! I live in the neighborhood and Joanne hosted my uncle and aunt who were visiting the city. Staying at Joanne's place was a delight for them. Apart from the fully stocked apartment with amazing views, Joanne was a delightful and warm host with tons of helpful tips. I would highly recommend Joanne's place to anyone visiting the city and looking to live like a local."
14767195,Sunnyside,"Really good place to stay for a great price in NYC! It takes about 25 minutes to get into Manhattan and the service to Amey's is very frequent. We had no trouble with transportation at all. 

There are also some great places to get lunch and dinner within Sunnyside (El Mole!), that can help you save a little bit if you don't want the Manhattan prices for food every day of our stay. 

Over all a really great experience for our first air bnb! Comfortable bed, coffee ready every morning, shower amenities were very clean, no complaints. :) 
"
262017,Sunnyside,"Shauna was really friendly and helped me with everything. She was so flexible concerning my check-in / check out time and did everything just to make sure that I'm fine. The room is lovely and there is enough space for luggage, etc ... it was very clean and we didn't miss anything. Thanks a lot! "
209310,Sunnyside,"I stayed for six happy weeks at Iulia's place, travelling to Manhattan every day and grateful to come home to a comfortable room in the evenings. The room is clean and very homely. There are lovely arm-chairs and a nice big bed with very nice bedding. There are personal items belonging to Iulia in the room, but it was made clear from the beginning that she was happy to make as much space for me as I needed.  The bathroom is right beside the bedroom around a corner at the end of the hall, so there is great privacy. And the view from the bedroom is gorgeous. Around half way through my stay, I realised that if I left one of the curtains a tiny bit open, I could see the Chrysler building from my bed! It's lit up at night and it catches the sun early in the morning :o)  I was also welcome to use anything I wished in the kitchen and had space in the fridge and in a kitchen cupboard, which was wonderful. Iulia is very welcoming and attentive to the needs of her guest; she takes the responsibilities of hosting seriously, and she is a naturally generous person. She's also an interesting person to talk to and she's great fun! The subway station is an easy walk, and there's a very friendly green-grocer's shop on the same street. While taking the train in the morning was not always particularly enjoyable, just because it can get crowded at rush-hour (who'd have thought it?), I liked living in Sunnyside! It was nice to get out of Manhattan in the evenings, and there are affordable supermarkets in the area - which is not the case in Manhattan. All in all, I can heartily recommend Iulia's apartment!"
9079960,Sunnyside,"Great apartment very clean and comfortable trains and buses nearby 
Had a great stay "
15399853,Sunset Park,A cozy room in a clean and inviting apartment. I was in town for business so the desk and good Wi-Fi connection was very appreciated. Parking is better than average for the city as well. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a room in a quieter part of town.
5571703,Sunset Park,"Blas nous attendait en bas de son appartement . Lorsqu'il nous a vu il nous a pris dans ses bras pour nous souhaiter la bienvenue. Contact très chaleureux et il nous a mis immédiatement à l'aise. Blas savait nous faire rire .
L'appartement était exactement comme sur les photos. Il est petit mais très propre. La surface de la chambre est suffisante puisque nous y étions que pour y dormir. Concernant le quartier , malgré les heures tardives de nos retours , nous nous sentions en sécurité. Le métro est bien à 5 minutes à pieds comme s'est écrit dans le descriptif de Blas. Nous garderons un formidable souvenir de notre séjour et de Blas qui y a contribué énormément! Il a toujours été là pour nous donner les bonnes adresses, il savait être là au bon moment et rester discret quand il le fallait etc... Nous le recommandons vivement. Si nous devions y retourner nous ne changerions pas d'adresse!"
573815,Sunset Park,"Tricia is an incredible host.  She is warm, welcoming, accommodating, personable and everything wonderful!  She has two adorable and loving kitties, who add good times to the overall experience.  Tricia's home is beautiful, clean, with immaculate decorative amenities down the last detail.  The bed is inviting and comfy; the private deck that overlooks her lush backyard has a rocking chair and colorful flowers; the super clean bathroom has a large Jacuzzi tub; coffee, tea and breakfast options await in the kitchen; and there are many options inside and out to enjoy a good book, write, read or share in conversation.  South Slope is ideally located - not too far from Prospect Park, right off 5th Ave, and near the R train to link up to other neighborhoods.  Tricia's organized self has a binder that has any and all information about the surrounding areas, leaving nothing to be desired about to-do options. I would highly recommend Tricia and her lovely home to anyone looking for a place to stay in Brooklyn!"
631601,Sunset Park,"Hello,

I stayed at Gus' place for 5 nights as I transition into moving to NYC!

Room was large and comfortable and has the kitchen and bathroom on the same floor!

The house is pretty quiet so you don't really see anyone and you have his room all to yourself.

Room was clean, on a quiet street off of a busier street with 24hour convenient stores and a few restaurants etc.

Great for any type of stay! I didn't meet Gus, but his housemates got me settled and Gus stayed in communication throughout my whole stay. 

Very prompt and courteous with his responses.

I would recommend his place to anyone looking. Also, for female travelers that are traveling alone, I would also recommend his place!"
228888,Sunset Park,"Ashley is an incredibly lovely and friendly person. She made me feel so at home and welcome. The apartment was clean, tidy and my room was very comfortable. I absolutely loved staying in Brooklyn and Park Slope in particular. Ashley informed me of all the cool places to visit in the area which was quite helpful. I ended up spending more time in Brooklyn than in Manhattan and I don't feel I missed out on a thing! In fact, my experience was enhanced because of it. Ashley and I got along so well that I told her that she was welcome to my home in Melbourne. I also met some of her friends who were also nice. She made my stay in NYC so much more enjoyable and I feel privileged to have met her and to be her friend. I can't speak highly enough about her. She was the perfect host. This was my very first booking through Airbnb and I can only hope that any future bookings I make can live up to this experience. Ashley has set the standard quite high! She truly is a wonderful, genuine, and lovely person and it was my pleasure to have stayed with her. "
2043832,Sunset Park,Bob's place was just awesome.  Convenient and quiet and located near the subway lines.  
8392929,Sunset Park,Nice house and nice people... A little deep into Brooklyn if you're a tourist and want to go back and forth to Manhattan a lot. But rooms look like on the pictures and it was nice and clean.
4040900,Theater District,Great place to stay In the heart of Manhattan. Lovely stay!! I just felt like home. Not to big but everything you need. Plus a perfect host :)
205043,Theater District,"Truly enjoyed my stay and the hospitality extended by the host - the location cannot be beat (blocks away from all the action but high enough up to not hear the hustle and bustle of downtown New York), and the views are - as many guests have already indicated - nothing short of spectacular. The place is sparsely decorated, which I happened to like as it provides a very clean and calming experience. The host is quiet as a mouse but never far from offering help or advice as needed. Would definitely consider staying again in the future, especially given the price-point as compared to hotel and other options. "
2206115,Theater District,"great location and host.  We were close to everything we needed to be and could easily walk.

Albert was fantastic and really helped when the need arose.

We would stay there again any time."
212178,Theater District,"Jeremy made us feel very welcome! He promptly greeted us and showed us around the apartment and explained everything. He made some great suggestions on places to eat and hang out in the area too. I loved that he shared fun stories about the building we were staying in. It made me feel right at home to know about the building a bit more and about the neighbors. He made sure to check up on us throughout our stay to make sure everything was okay and that our trip was going good. From the bottle of wine he left for us to the impeccably clean interior of the apartment, everything was perfect. The place was soooo quiet and relaxing after a long day touring the city. I can't wait to stay there again on our next trip! This was my first AirBnb experience and it was everything I had hoped it would be and more!"
4261693,Theater District,"We had a great stay! Very communicative, great location, everything just went incredibly smoothly! "
394474,Theater District,"Eddie was a great host. He met me at the apt even though my arrival time was quite late (10:30pm) and he was flexible with departure time. He also provided additional towels/linens upon request. The apartment is as advertised. Great location, central to many sites as well as fantastic restaurants. Of note, the apartment is quite noisy, as it is very centrally located - to be expected when you're in the the middle of Manhattan, but not ideal for those who are sensitive to noise. All in all a wonderful experience!"
9720768,Theater District,"This apartment is perfect! The location is amazing, the apartment is super clean, very comfortable, I went with 2 friends and it was perfect for us. Troy is a great host! He was very responsive, he helped us with our luggage, he had no problem when we asked if we could do the check-in earlier. I would definitely stay here again."
999248,Tribeca,"I do not believe that my fellow family members and myself could have received a warmer and more informative welcoming tour than we were given. We were greeted outside the door, guided into and up the elevator and then shown about the apartment and all of it's unique splendour. 
We all felt as though we have been given a very open armed introduction to the community that we resided in during our stay in Tribeca, New York. Cafes and restaurants dotted around the area were convenient and of a very nice quality, heightening our enjoyment. 
Almost all systems and technologies were effective within the apartment; I must admit that my favourite aspects were heating that I could escape into from the bitter cold and high speed wifi! "
188087,Tribeca,"This was my first time using airbnb and I have to say I was very pleased with my experience. The loft was spacious, clean and the kind of place where you can relax and feel at home. The location was perfect - surrounded by coffee shops, restaurants, and within walking distance of Tribeca, Little Italy and Chinatown. 

David was a wonderful host. He called to make sure everything was okay and was available by cellphone in case we needed anything.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back."
8067466,Tribeca,You cannot ask for a better host. NI's was extremely kind and make my stay a very nice one. The apt was spotless and I had a great night rest. Can't say thank you enough.
13981277,Two Bridges,Awesome location. We were able to get to most places we wanted to see just by walking.  Although we didn't get to meet Henry in person he was very attentive via text messages. Would definitely recommend! 
2715985,Vinegar Hill,What a gorgeous apartment! We loved the view and the location was very convenient. 
9905122,Woodside,This amazing private apartment was exactly as posted. It is a very economic stay for those who want to see NYC on a budget. This was perfect for my son and I who were in town for college visits and to spend a little time in NYC. I highly recommend staying here and I would stay again anytime. Communication and check-in was outstanding. Very close walk to the subway and we were apartment to Times Square in 15-20 minutes from door to arrival at Times Square. Highly recommended. Thank you!
13142258,Woodside,"We were on a family trip to NYC. It was a great experience staying at Wayne's place. The location is unbeatable. It's a 3-min walk to the nearest metro station. Line 7 stops at the Grand Central Station, 5th Ave., Times Square, etc., and it's very convenient to transfer to other metro lines. Wayne's place is very clean, spacious, and cozy. You get your own entrance to the home which ensures privacy. Yet Wayne's parents live on the second floor, and they are always there if you need help. Wayne and his parents are super nice. They want to make sure we enjoy our stay. We really did and we would stay there again if we go to NYC next time.     "
3325617,Woodside,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 6 nights stay at Shawn's and Christine's place. The place was spacious and tidy. The area was quiet, close to a main street packed with shops, cafes, pubs and even a coin laundry if you (like us) need it! Close proximity to the subway and bus stosp provides a great link with Queens/Brooklyn and Manhattan. Five star hosts - thank you for having us!"
15338155,Woodside,Jose is a great host! Took the time to welcome us and guide us on where to go and enjoy the city. Btw the ENTIRE apartment looked amazing! 
2848235,University Heights,"Great experience honestly. I was comfortable throughout my stay. Rossy and Juan were very welcoming when I first arrive. I didn't see them much, but when I did, they were always very nice. I definitely recommend this place."
7035513,Upper East Side,"Apartment very well situated for our needs.Good bus connections,very convinient to take our kids to day camp.
Very nice host,flexible with entry and departure time.
We've stayed two years in a row and hope to be back next summer."

562478,Upper East Side,"Renne is an excelent host, he was waiting for us and helped us carry the lugage upstairs.
The location is excelent, two blocks from m79 that crosses Manhattan. "
4455138,Upper East Side,Warm and welcoming peter stayed in close contact to ensure a great experience. 
4580384,Upper East Side,"The apartment was as advertised - very clean with nice decor. The bed was comfortable and Allison provided everything we would need to enjoy our stay. She was also readily available via email or phone to answer any questions as they came up.

The neighborhood was relatively quiet at night (though there were still things to see and do), and we felt safe walking around. If you plan on taking the subway, it is about a 10-minute walk to the closest subway station.

We enjoyed walking around Central park. Try the papaya juice at the corner of 86th and 3rd (I think)!"
6163657,Upper East Side,"The apartment was absolutely stunning!  Not only was the apartment in a prime location, but also the perfect size for two people.  The natural light pouring in through the windows made the apartment just that much more lovely.  Also, the apartment was very clean!  Giulia was a wonderful host and easy to contact.  She answered any questions we had and allowed us to leave our things in the apartment even after 'check-out’, which helped us out a great deal!  Overall, we enjoyed our stay in the city very much and would definitely stay here again.  "
7613146,Upper East Side,Lina's place was cute and cozy. There were other guests staying also and they were extremely noisy and inconsiderate. It's not Lina's fault but sharing bathroom with them was difficult since we are girls and they were guys (they also took one hour shower). But Lina was friendly and nice. I wish other guests were more considerate and we didn't have to share that tiny bathroom. 
9475812,Upper East Side,Second time here. Great place. Highly recommended. 
11738831,Upper East Side,Great host! No complaints. 
13061315,Upper East Side,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2838328,Upper East Side,"As described in the description. Convenient walk to subway stations. It can be very noisy but if that bothers you, ear plugs will take care of it. Henry the host is easily reached via text and always responded right away."
4943458,Upper East Side,JUE AND ADAM! are the sweetest people !they were very welcoming and helped me with maps and suggested many places to visit! I can honestly say I've made friends that i can  go enjoy the city with when I go back and visit!
6391684,Upper East Side,"Même si nous n'avons pas réussi à nous croiser avec Carine, nous avons été reçu dans un charmant appartement, bien équipé, avec des conseils très complets concernant les bonnes adresses du quartier. Il y a bien six couchages, mais l'espace à vivre peut s'avérer un peu juste à plus de quatre. A réserver aux groupes qui ne cherchent un appartement que pour dormir."

Good value
Safe and quite
Nice communication"
2060612,Upper East Side,"Peter was very hospitable and super communicative. He also accommodated us with a late night check in, which we appreciated. The place was on the smaller side for the two of us, and there were a few quirks with the place including a smoke smell. Nonetheless, it was close to the subway and Central Park. "
8112802,Upper East Side,"Dim is a very friendly guy, almost never home, but he left fresh flowers when we arrived, with towels and fresh bed sheets. The location is perfect, 4 minute walk to Guggenheim Museum, 9 minutes to the Met and of course 4 minutes to Central Park. 5 minutes to Subway line 4,5,6 on 86th street. On the 3rd avenue there is tons of restaurants and a whole foods. Right on the corner is a Mini Market, we bought everything there for breakfast and snacks. There is no silverware and no plates in the apartment and the Restroom and shower could be cleaner, overall a great experience and we would be back to Dim again. "
7457099,Upper East Side,"The apartment was just how it was presented in the pictures. Spacious and clean. Great location. We would definitely rent again from Bo. 
"
244547,Upper East Side,The host was helpful and friendly providing directions to the apartment and meeting me with the keys. I spent most of my time out exploring NYC. The bathroom is small and there were issues with the toilet that were resolved after 24hours. 
10673295,Upper East Side,"A great place and a great host!

This place is located at a great location, only a few blocks from The Met and Metro. Though the host was not able to greet us when we checked in, but she made sure Suzanne to give us clear instructions on how to get the key and help us familiar with the apartment. Though we had other tenants in the apartment, both of them were super quiet. Matt helped us with the heater, he was super nice as well. 

The apartment is really lovely and very clean. 

I'm so happy to choose this place as my first personal AirBnb experience. It was a wonderful experience. "
2489407,Upper East Side,"Daniel was the most welcoming host in the cosiest apartment during a cold February NY visit. His easy to follow directions to the safe, quiet Upper East Side address saw me no hassle to the door whereupon entering, I was greeted with cultured and artistic taste in music, literature and conversation. The cosiest bed and provision of breakfast each morning rounded off an excellent place to stay in NY. "
5699348,Upper East Side,"Marie is amazing. She took care of me at the beginning of the booking process.
The flat is close to Subway Station, restaurants and bars.  "

5856557,Upper East Side,"Cute little apartment on the upper east side- great value for money. Lovely quiet street and very safe and nice neighbourhood. Lots of restaurants, grocery stores and a laundry nearby along with other shops and services. The only minor issue was that it would have been good if it was a bit closer to the subway as it's about a 25 minute fast paced walk (as it is in the middle of 77th subway station and 84th subway station).  The Air conditioning struggled a bit but it was a very hot two weeks while we were there. Overall I would recommend this place for an authentic Manhattan experience. "

1029118,Upper East Side,"Nice and clean appart, well localisated. Akilah was very helpful and I thanks her again.
A good and cheap adress to have breakfast, less  than 1 minute walking: The Ritz diner, at the corner Of 1st av and 62th street.
I recommand this location and her host."
13250230,Upper East Side,"Our stay with David was Amazing! He was able to check us in later in the evening with no problem and was very nice and accommodating. Easy communication.  We felt very special given that the apartment was brand new. You could see that everything was just renovated & all of the linens, towels, bedding & furniture was new. It was quite a treat to enjoy our time in the city in this Large 2 bedroom 2 bathroom loft. The two bathrooms were both spectacular marble bathrooms. It was quite a treat in a city like NYC to have 2 full bathrooms of this caliber. We have traveled and used the website many times before and my family and I truly think this was our best experience. We strongly Recommend David & his new Loft to anyone.  He gave us tons of nearby recommendations in a nifty guidebook PDF document that had so many insights. We enjoyed some restaurants that we would have likely never found. Little insights such as this make all the difference. A big city like NYC you can easily get lost without some insights. Hosts like david who go above and beyond are what make this website great.  We suggest anyone to book this loft. We cannot wait to come back one day and stay here again. 
The bedrooms were spacious and accommodating. The bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment which provided a lot of privacy and separation. A brand new kitchen with gorgeous cabinetry and appliances was fully stocked. The large beds & the new plush mattresses were simply a treat. David checked in with us regularly to make sure everything was great. You set the bar very high and we hope everyone knows that. The apartment was close to the Metro stations & Central park. Lots of nearby restaurants, shops, & activities. We only wish that we could have stayed longer! We thank you David for making this a wonderful experience and going above and beyond in every way. "
13340543,Upper East Side,"Mindy was phenomenal! She helped accommodate us even though we flew in on a really early Red Eye. 

The place was exactly as described and close to all the Transit. Add this to being in one of the greatest cities on the planet and 5 stars does not come close to this location. 

Mindy's place is closer to a 10 star locale. "
848220,Upper East Side,"Wonderful location, close to shops, about a 1/2 mile to subway station.  Very nice apt., clean and cozy."
8402908,Upper East Side," AJ was an awesome host! My friend and I had an amazing stay at his place this past weekend. AJ's spot was great to uber in and out of the city pretty easily. Also, his home was very welcoming during our down time. I highly recommend if you are looking to stay away from the busy city life but want easy access to have fun in the city as well. "
1320550,Upper East Side,"great location, place was exactly as described, patricia was a great host"
2367089,Upper East Side,"Perfect apt for 2 people. Great location, fully stocked, and looked just like the listing. Alice was very responsive."
2623348,Upper East Side,"Great location, easy access to everywhere in NY. We loved walking the city so it gave us the opportunity to see even more of New York as most days we walked from Greenwich/Soho areas back to the apartment. 
The room was great, just what we needed! Definitely recommend Michael and Robert's apartment, we would stay here again. Thank you guys for letting us stay! "
4589307,Upper East Side,"Nis was there to meet us and assist us with anything that we needed to know about the apartment and NYC.  She was very friendly and helpful!   The apartment was  exactly as pictured on the website and perfect for us.   We had a fabulous stay!   We would definitely stay there again as it was perfectly located 2 blocks from Central Park, 4 blocks from the metro and there were many places to eat from cafes to restaurants and even an organic market next door!   this was our first experience with Airbnb and it turned out great!"
14772799,Upper East Side,"É necessário esclarecer que o prédio não tem elevador e o apartamento fica no terceiro andar. A escada é estreita e foi complicado com as malas.
O bairro é muito bom, transporte, supermercado e restaurantes próximos. 
Não conhecemos o Thomas porque nosso voo chegou após o horário do check in. O apartamento é o que aparece nas fotos. A internet não estava funcionando e só arrumou após a segunda reclamação."
6493181,Upper East Side,"Antonella and Giuseppe were very attentive hosts who made themselves readily available to answer any questions we had. The apartment was excellent - clean, well-equipped and in a great location. There were lots of great restaurants and a supermarket nearby as well as a subway station which made getting around very easy. We walked to Central Park, The Met and the Natural Hist Museum and the neighborhood felt very safe. We dropped our washing at the laundry next door who had it done within 24 hours and it was very cheap. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great week in NYC! "
9464137,Upper East Side,Naomi was such a welcoming and helpful host! She made extra efforts to prepare the apartment and was very responsive to questions. She really knows the city well. The apartment was very comfortable and in a really convenient neighborhood. I would definitely start there again!
4347881,Upper East Side,"Bruno is a very nice host ! His place is not very large, but he has done his very best to make my stay as confortable as possible !
The location of Bruno's place is great, very close to Central Park and the metro."
9457545,Upper East Side,"This is an amazing value for anyone who needs a home base in UES. For a lower price than just staying in a private room, you get a whole apartment to yourself, and no stairs to climb. It's basic, but very clean and functional, and the host is a great communicator. Key pickup/dropoff was clear and simple. Highly recommended...I'll try to stay here again if I can!"
2210041,Upper West Side,"This was my second stay with Mena and it was just as delightful as the first visit! She is always so hospitable and helpful, and the cozy guest quarters have everything you need from extra storage, hangers, and the the little amenities I love at hotels like mini shampoos or a hairdryer and an iron, just incase you forgot yours! ;) The location is perfect - close to Central Park and subway stations. There's a deli just downstairs that has all groceries you could need for a visit. Coffee shops and cafes are all around in the charming Upper West Side! Her apartment feels like my home away from home when I'm in NYC now. Thanks for everything Mena! Hope to see you again soon! "
708374,Upper West Side,"Arlette's bedroom with bathroom on the Park was very comfortable, and the location couldn't  have been better, with subway access just down the street. For neighborhood eateries we suggest exploring Broadway to the west. It was wonderful having Central Park so close - navigating the city was a breeze from this locality. Thank you, Arlette!"
1615083,Upper West Side,"Emily’s place is perfect, just as advertised, no surprises. Location is great, everything was arranged for my arrival. I would definitely stay here again when visiting nyc."
2165795,Upper West Side,"The host was absolutely spectacular - very welcoming, accommodating. The space was super clean and true to the pictures, and in a very cool and safe area in NYC, as well as accessible to all the wonders and attractions of the city. I felt very at ease with the whole arrangement. The place itself is such a dream - I'd love to live in a place like that sometime in the future. Positively spacious for one, and could comfortably accommodate two. It was a wonderful weekend getaway, and I can't thank the host enough!"
10539491,Upper West Side,Great location!! Free parking on the street was easy for us and we walked and played in Central Park numerous times. My 7 year old spent all her time playing with the toys in the apartment; it was so nice to have her entertained. Suzette was very nice when we met her briefly. The building felt safe and it was nice to see the school on the ground floor and all the families in the building.
8364692,Upper West Side,He made me very comfortable. I was treaveling on my own. So I worried about my safety. But They(the hosts) made me cozy and they were very gentle. Thanks brother northstars;)!
14710115,Upper West Side,"The apartment is exactly as described and  as shown in the pictures. It is bright spacious and well equipped. The apartment is large, by NY standards.
The host was very friendly and accommodating for a check in a couple of hours earlier. He was very helpful and really made me feel as if I was staying at a friend's place. 
The location is great, in the Lincoln Center area,  and there is a Subway station just two blocks away. Plenty of restaurants and shops around.   
Highly recommended.  I will stay here in the future, when visiting NYC."
1793091,Upper West Side,"Ana Maria's place was great! It was conveniently located near the subway and Central Park. Ana Maria and her partner  were there to let us in, show the space and provide the keys. The room, kitchenette and bathroom were cosy, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed."
1328080,Upper West Side,"The place was exactly as described, and felt comfortable and homey. The host was friendly and helpful. I wasn't in the apartment much besides to sleep, and during that time my host mainly just stayed in his room, so it felt like I had the place to myself. The bed is a futon but was comfortable and had nice pillows. A warning is that if you are 6"" or taller, your feet may hit the arm rest, but I just slept diagonally, so it wasn't an issue for me."
6628193,Upper West Side," The appartement is located in a nice area near two subway line. Very convenient.
It was a very pleasant stay."
1120700,Upper West Side,We stayed at Oriya and his family's place for 5 nights. It was a very pleasant quiet place to stay ideally located for metros and buses to laguardia airport. They respected our needs of using their house as a base whilst spending the majority of our time downtown. Would highly recommend. The family were very friendly for the few times we saw them in our busy three days. Positive start to our airbnb experience.
6541532,Upper West Side,Kirsten was incredibly friendly and welcoming to my friend and I to her apartment. She gave us great advice on places to go and was really down to earth! The apartment is in a great location close to Central Park with good transport links. The area was safe. The apartment provided us a great base for our activities.
4860430,Upper West Side,"Shailah's apartment is in an IDEAL Manhattan location, and I would definitely stay there again. She is a lovely host - responsive, friendly and attentive, but also gave me my space. I stayed with her after nearly 40 hours of international travel, which left me exhausted and with tons of luggage. After I had finished my stay, she found me splayed out on the floor of her lobby, trying to condense my multiple suitcases into one, as I had to lug all my things to and on the subway and it was FREEZING COLD outside. She was so thoughtful to offer me a ride (as she was moving her car), which I gladly accepted. "
8337340,Upper West Side,Rays apartment was in a great location easy walking distance to many places we went to including Central Park and the check in process was easy. 
3838375,Upper West Side,"Lisa was at the apartment when we checked in.  She gave me a tour of her place and instructions of her household & the amenites she has.  She left many post-it notes of where things are and how to run things (you can never have too many post-its staying in someone else's home).  She made me feel like she trusted me & my family to stay in her home even though I felt like I was intruding her space.  I really like that she trusted my son to take care of her sons' 3 fire-belly toads and allowed him to play with the toys that were there.  She left a ""surprise"" in the fridge for the adults which was truly welcomed and a very nice touch!
The apartment is as beautiful as it was in the description.  Huge front windows allowed natural light in the roomy living room, the bedrooms were comfortable as were the beds and the sofa!  The kitchen is gorgeous with modern appliances, a hot water tap, gas range & oven, and a Keurig brewer.  Bathroom is well equipped as well, water pressure is awesome, just as Lisa described in her listing.  The whole place is cozy, many personal touches such as her handmade vessel sink in the bathroom and handmade backsplash tiles in the kitchen.   Wifi works flawlessly and its FAST!   It is nicely decorated in a way only an artist can execute.  
The apartment is located on a quiet street in UWS, across the street from an elementary school and next to a church.  It was ideal for our family because my sister lives about 3 blocks away!  We felt safe in her place and would love to return to stay there whenever we visit New York City. "
169532,Upper West Side,"We really had a great stay at Jamie' s!! 
She's really nice and smilling, her cat is cute and the appartment is clean!
We stayed 4 nigths, it was really well located! We recommand Jamie's place to everybody!

Nous avons passé un super séjour (4jours) chez Jamie, elle est vraiment cool et dispo pour répondre aux questions et propose des activités aux alentours. La chambre est dans le séjour mais la porte se ferme et cela sert de chambre. L'appart était bien situé et propre. Lucky, son chat était gentil !"
5221073,Upper West Side,Logement fonctionnel et propre dans un quartier calme . Le métro ainsi que les commerces se trouvent à quelques rues . la personne qui gère l'appartement est très disponible .

489962,Upper West Side,"The place is in a nice, quiet, safe location. It's very small but efficient for 2 people. Very close to Central Park. Bed is comfortable and place is cozy. "
15246070,Upper West Side,"Great place! Can't say anything more than just a great experience in the wonderful apt. Love this sweet little room. The whole apt is mordern and clean. The bathroom has nice showers with plenty of hot water and the kitchen is well-equipped. It is a safe area with many good restaurants and supermarkets nearby. The metro and bus stops are just around the corner or only two blocks away. This room is espeicially perfect for a single lady and also fits two. I and my bf are fine with this anyway. If you want a bigger bedroom, there is another bedroom for rent in the same apt. The price is a bit higher but worth it. Overall, I highly recommend this place. "
2014701,Upper West Side,"Molly was a wonderful host, and her studio was just as pictured - lovely and luminous! She was very responsive to my request and any questions, and very accommodating of my arrival and departure times!  

The location is wonderful, steps away from the subway, and so close to all of the West side! 

I absolutely recommend staying here!!"

10343320,Upper West Side,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and Kristen made it very easy.  She was very helpful in making a booking.  The only draw back was the logistics of the KeyCafe.  It was a bit confusing and added more time to our arrival than expected.  Otherwise, we had a nice stay, and enjoyed how close the apartment was to the Subway stop and Central Park!  "
6355471,Upper West Side,"Stayed at Hanh's cosy apartment in August on a recent trip to New York. Flat was perfect for us, clean, cosy, great location and communication with Hanh made it really easy to get there. It was great, the neighbourhood is fine, lots of places to eat locally, right by a subway and just enough away from the real busy parts that you could actually relax back at the flat. In fact the Malaysian grill (nearest restaurant) was probably one of the best meals we had and great value for money. 
Hanh was a lovely host. She was always ready to communicate if we had any issues (we didn't) and nothing was a problem. Everything was where she said it was and we really felt at home. Thank you Hanh for such a positive experience for us on our trip. Dan"

326908,Upper West Side,"Michelle made me feel really welcome into her home. The room was really nice, with a comfortable bed. The area was a safe area and as a young female travelling on my own I felt perfectly safe walking to the apartment at night. The subway is really close to the apartment and takes 15 minutes to get to Times Square. A perfect place to stay for a few days in NYC, I will definitely be returning!"
305670,Upper West Side,"Shoshannah is an excellent host, she is very quiet, great person and her house is very nice, the room has a lot of space and very nice queen bed! Also, I've been there in plenum winter and the apartment was really warm! Everything was excellent and Shoshannah and her apartment is highly recomendable!"
298920,Upper West Side,"We stayed at William's flat for 5 nights in June 2014 and it was a wonderful experience. As a family of 4 (2 teenagers) hotels are not really practical with no room to unpack/pack and relax. William's flat is in an excellent area, just off Amsterdam Ave, only a couple of blocks to the Subway (1, B, C), 5 min to Central Park (very close to reservoir) with an amazing cafe right next door. There are tons of other restaurants right on your doorstep as well.  The upper west side is a lovely area of NYC - easily accessible and very quick to get down to places like Time Square but just far enough away from the very busy crowded (and noisy) areas. The apartment had a big kitchen (which we never used of course with so many amazing restaurants on our doorstep !), good sized lounge with very comfy couches for relaxing after a busy day of shopping/eating and two large bedrooms (for NYC standards). A lot of other places we looked at could probably have fitted the whole flat in William's lounge ! Would strongly recommend William's flat for other people looking for a great way to stay in NYC - we would not hesitate to stay there again for our next visit"
8878181,Upper West Side,Min was an excellent host. 
5949599,Upper West Side,"He placed us temporarily at a home that has his own staff, fringe completely full of his food and liquor with no room for us!!
He did not professionally cleaned the house that was full of dust and dirt!! He refused to move us to the home we signed for and asked us to find a hotel??!! He wasted 2 days of my valuable vacation time !! Simply when I mentioned 5th floor is very tiry for my wife !! He was not understanding, if we had a phone discussion instead of texting things may have worked fine!!"
1003530,Upper West Side,Greta was very welcoming and flexible.  My friend and I slept well in comfortable beds under soft cotton sheets in this lovely quiet flat on the upper west side.  We walked to the Museum of Natural History and hopped on the subway (less than one block away!) to go downtown.  Greta's place offered a sweet artful respite from the rush of the city.
15418694,Upper West Side,"The room was clean, cozy, and couldn't have been in a better location. It was really easy to navigate to and from the apartment. Mary was very sweet and happy to provide me with anything I needed. Great stay and a great host."

It was also a short walk from a convenience store. Thanks, Brian!"

537280,Windsor Terrace,"A lovely stay overall. Great location. Comfy bed. Nice host. The only surprise for me, that wasn't abundantly clear from the description, is that the bed room is an ""open"", not an enclosed, loft. There is no bedroom door and one of the walls is open to the staircase down to the living room. It was tucked away enough to feel private, but it wasn't exactly. "

4594970,Windsor Terrace,"Michelle and Dan's place was a good choice for my girlfriend and I's weekend getaway in Brooklyn. They seem to be a very lovely couple and Michelle was a great help, very cool about giving us suggestions as well as answering questions (and I'm sure I had more than the usual guest as it was our first time using airbnb) 

The location was quiet opposed to most of Brooklyn. We were further from Williamsburg and Park Slope than anticipated but that was my own lack of research. Still it's very close to public transport so everything was easy to navigate. Also, we really enjoyed the quiet after being out all day! Huge bonus is the morning light in this place. It's gorgeous, and I can't stress enough how comfortable and inviting the apartment's decor is. It's been updated since the pictures to include a desk as well. The projector was a very cool alternative to TV but we couldn't figure it out for the life of us, and were bummed when we did (I think) since we didn't have an HDMI adapter for our Mac with us. Not a big deal since we were there to sightsee, not watch movies. The bedroom is a great size and superbly comfortable, also with wonderful lighting. There's a no shoe rule (completely understandable in NYC) so the wood floors made us slide around a little but that was funnier than anything else..

In a city with a lack of space, I always find myself feeling cramped and this spot completely erased that feeling. For two people, it's luxurious. You could easily fit 3-4 if need be. Don't forget to look out the balcony to the left, there's usually a horse or two at the corner..  It was a pleasant and unexpected surprise for NYC ! 

Overall, we were very happy with our choice. Free street parking is a plus if you're driving in. Great spot for couples to relax. Family friendly building as well.  There's many options around this area and price point but for the great host, hassle-free experience and the awesome space.. it's completely worth it, so we would definitely stay at Michelle & Dan's again!

970659,Washington Heights,"Our host was great.  Pierre was out of town but he went out of his way to ensure we were still able to get access.  The apartment feels like you are staying in a fancy hotel at a fraction of the price-- except that there are three bedrooms and a common area.  Regardless, Pierre has setup the rooms he rents as great little self-sufficient rental units.  There was a microwave, fridge, Keurig, and safe in our room.  He pays attention to all the little details.  We had chocolates and towels and toiletries.  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again! "

He helped me with the luggage even after the checkout and he was very kind letting a adapter for foreign outlets :) The place is very comfy and better than a regular hotel. 40 minutes to Times Square via subway and a lot of stores nearby. In my next travel probably I will try to stay in his place again.
8250457,West Village,"We had a great experience staying in Catrina's flat in the Village. The neighborhood was wonderful - Catrina provided excellent nearby food recommendations. Everything was clean and comfortable; the coffee, tea, and bottled waters were an appreciated touch! Her listing had great (and accurate) photos and the price was very reasonable - key reasons we selected her listing. We would love to stay here again in the future."
4180538,West Village,"This was exactly what I needed for my weekend stay in New York. First, I was allowed to drop my bags off early, which was a saving grace! The host was extremely kind and accomodating...I was greeted at the door, and immediately made to feel at home. 

The apartment was clean, cozy, and equipped with all the essentials (Iron, ironing board, hair dryer, water filter, full-length mirror, soap, etc.). The location was ideal...a 2 minute walk from the subway, and surrounded by great restaurants and shops. I really enjoyed my stay, and I'd definitely consider staying here again!

"
815045,West Village,"This spot was perfect!
Loved the location and was easy to get around.
We were able to do a lot of walking to site see and just enjoy the lower Manhattan area.
Great view and the front desk was awesome! (James)
Thanks to Marina for being apart of a very special weekend."
13990413,West Village,"Chris was great - very responsive. This is one of the best, most dynamic neighborhoods in NYC (we live nearby - our apartment was being renovated). Exceptionally neat and clean. Doorman building a plus."
5184044,West Village,Alyssa was extremely helpful from beginning to end.  Place was as described and could not have asked for a better location.  The subway stop was 100m away and had a lot of lines stopping there which meant we hardly needed to change trains at all.  The neighbourhood was everything we wanted from our NYC experience!  There were some issues due to works in the building but otherwise can not fault Alyssa and her service.
6647114,West Village,"Kristin was SUCH a wonderful host. She made me feel right at home throughout my stay in her beautiful loft. It was just as described, a cozy nook (very comfortable mattress), and some space for privacy in the living room. All in all it was a great experience and I look forward to many more stays with Kristin in the future. "
885360,West Village,"Rachel flat is really well placed. Nosy like you would expect from a flat in the center of this kind of big city, but not that much. Her flatmate Lala was really friendly and very funny. I really had good time there. Thank you both. See you next time I m around."
7713421,West Village,Daniella has a beautiful apartment and the area is amazing for livability and going out.  Everything was made available and clear to me. Communication was easy and professional.  Great experience.
898669,West Village,What a cute place! Right in the heart of the west village and close to everything you may want or need. Brian was easy to communicate with and a great host. Very helpful if you have any questions.  Can't  wait to come back again! Thank you!
9429904,West Village,"Key pickup was a breeze, and very secure (using keycafe). The West Village neighborhood was fantastic. We were fortunate to find such a great townhouse in one of the most eclectic and happening neighborhoods of New York. Great proximity to some of the best food and drink places NY has to offer.
Jordan was very responsive by text and email, and usually responded within minutes. Jordan has furnished his townhouse very well: very comfortable bedding, all basic necessities (kitchen appliances, dishes, cutlery, plenty of towels, great WiFi and Apple TV, wine, breakfast food like oatmeal and coffee; everything you can think of!). I required a late check-out on my last day in NY, and Jordan was very accommodating, despite the last-minute notice.
One of the best Airbnb experiences we have had. I highly recommend Jordan's townhouse, and am looking forward to staying here on my next NY visit. 
"
970150,West Village,I had a great experience staying at J's place. The place was clean - great location - just perfect.  J was very friendly and nice person and she gave me a lot of suggestion for where to go and eat.  I will recommend her place to if you are traveling solo or couple and friends. 
7306108,West Village,"Brett and his brother made us feel totally at home. Our flight arrived after 1:00 AM and they still managed to get the keys to us and get us settled. That was above and beyond what we'd hoped for. The apartment is cozy, very quiet, and located in the absolutely best location in New York's best neighborhood. As ex-New Yorkers, we felt like we were instantly back home. Thank you, Brett, for a great stay."

Great location , has everything you need to pass a wonderful time in the city , the apartment is smaller than I had imagined from the pictures on the site , suitable for couples but not more than that , Matt was great and immediatly responde to every need ,I will happily return!! Thanks Tom and Matt
"
44288,West Village,This is a charming and very functional apartment in an ideal location in the W. Village. Close to several subway stops and lines. Elevator and concierge in building. The owner replied quickly and helpfully to all queries. An excellent experience.
2057295,West Village,"Loved my experience in Amanda's home! The neighborhood is amazing and Amanda left a great list of restaurants to check out during my stay. Her home is exactly as listed; quiet, clean, and very homey. Great place to stay during your time in NYC!"
1656539,West Village,I had a very enjoyable stay at Ann's.  The room was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was just outside the bedroom door which was very convenient.  The neighborhood was nice and I found it relatively quiet. It served my needs perfectly.
16068854,West Village,"Finally, we found a new New York Airbnb we like. A great Airbnb experience from start to finish. The apartment was CLEAN! And not just made to ""look"" clean but thoroughly sanitized (could still smell the clorox in the bathroom, which was great). This was important to us and both Aris and his brother Antonio made sure our areas of concern - bed, sheets, bath towels, bathroom - were 100% clean. In fact, we so appreciated Aris's brother Antonio calling us directly a few days prior to our arrival to go over some of our requested needs. Communication with Aris and his brother Antonio were fast to respond, thorough, and easy. The apartment was huge, esp the living room. Bathroom/bedroom were a comfortable size. Bed/comforter were comfortable. The location is central surrounded by metro stops, non-stop cabs going down this busy street, only 20 min walk to everything. We loved that the apartment was on the highest floor but for families with children this might not suit them as well. We were in NYC during a rainy cold January week and with the exception of one very windy day, the apartment was warm, there was ample hot water while showering, we had no problems with the plumbing. Since Aris was out of town, Antonio met us at the apartment and was as friendly as could be, and let us check-out a few hours late. Many thanks to Aris and Antonio for your genuine hospitality. "
861689,West Village,"David's place in the West Village is beautiful place. The apartment has all you need staying in NYC. I have stayed in more apt in NYC, but this is the best. Also the location is excellent, walking distant from everything you need and is a beautiful neighborhood. David is a great host, he was out of the city, but he managed to keep in contact and he could be reached when needed."
3781934,West Village,Love Love Love! NYC means you need to walk and climb stairs.  Loved being on 4th floor - only three flights 48 steps - gets easier each time - unit is great - Lexis is best - very communicative and accommodating.  Thanks Lexis for a great 2 weeks! 
3548393,West Village,"We felt at home at Kim's lovely apartment, with comfy beds, great pillows, fine space and awesome neighborhood."
2887761,West Village,"Kate was an amazing host and we had an incredible time in her apartment. She was super responsive to emails, texts, and phone calls and really flexible in regards to check in and check out times. She even stocked the fridge with some essentials and left us some wine and chocolate on the first. The apartment is located right in the heart of West Village in walking distance to numerous restaurants, bars, and little shops. SOHO is a mere 10 min walk as well. The apartment was extremely clean and stocked with all the basics needed for our stay.
I would recommend staying in Kate`s apartment without any hesitation. "
262583,West Village,"Really great apartment in an awesome area!! Emmett was very friendly and accommodating. 
Little loud out on Bleecker St but use ear plugs or drink enough not to let it bother you. Shower head needs more pressure. Otherwise it's a great place and would highly recommended it! "
292047,West Village,"Cristina was an excellent hostess! She even helped me carry my suitcase up the 5 flights of stairs.

The area is ideal! Short walking distance to BbU, Chelsea Shops, Spice Market, the subway and much, much more!

The room is simple, clean and spacious (especially in NYC).

The bathroom was clean and available.

The only negative is the five flights of stairs. 

Everything else was perfect! I would stay here again for sure."
3827442,West Village,"I never met Matthew, I spoke with him over the phone a couple of times. Everything was well organized and I did not need to meet him personally. The apartment was very clean and we loved the location. I really cannot think of anything that I felt was wrong. Thanks Matthew."
283377,West Village,Amazing!!! Lovely please !!! Thanks for the experience!!
8054018,Williamsburg,"Buse and her partner did a wonderful job making me feel welcome. All around great. Also, they do a lot of little things that make the experience really pleasant: the wifi info printed out, candles in the room, chocolates, and nice decorations. They were really hassle free to get in touch, get the keys, talk through check in time, etc.  The place was clean and accessible. Excellent all around. I look forward to next time."
12698900,Williamsburg,Cozy apartment and great location only a few blocks from the subway.  Perfect for a nice weekend in Williamsburg!
489365,Williamsburg,"This was our first airbnb experience and it exceeded every expectation we had. Not only is the place aesthetically beautiful it is also convenient for traveling to Manhattan and the Williamsburg area.

Our first night in we did not arrive until almost 2 am but with Carter's easy instruction we had zero problems getting into the apartment. Perhaps it was luck, but we had no issues parking our car on the street right outside for free Thursday night- Sunday morning! 

Unlike your typical hotel, Carter went above and beyond with providing a very comfortable bed, lovely scented organic toiletries, and to top it off a wide array of amazing books and art perfectly placed throughout his home.  To sum it up- this place was amazing and we would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone looking for a New York getaway. "
1014129,Williamsburg,"My stay here was fantastic. Their apartment is extremely cozy and stylish, making you feel like you're in a well-cared for home. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet the hosts, but Tracy left a great packet of information on nearby restaurants, bars and attractions that I definitely used to my advantage. Would return without a question!"
598612,Williamsburg,We had a great time at this appartment. The location is perfect with a fantastic view over Manhattan. The appartment is very nice with a nice balcony. We stayed with the four of us. The walk to the subway takes 5 minutes and 10 minutes later your in Manhattan. Fabio and Bruna are very friendly and everything was arranged very well.
243708,Williamsburg,Had a great time! Excellent communication with Andrija! Highly recommended!
6716695,Williamsburg,"Small and affordable room, like in the description. We only got to see the hosts for a short time but they responded to every question right away. The location is close to two train stations where you'll get around quiet well. "
14665418,Williamsburg,"Everything was really well setup and the place was perfect for our needs. The wifi worked great, air conditioning was a real bonus in each bedroom. The location was great too - was really easy to get everywhere from that address. "

2537745,Williamsburg,"Ginnie's apartment is adorable and in a great area of williamsburg.. Ginnie was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Her apartment was very clean, cozy and nicely decorated. Her bed is also extremely comfortable. I would stay again!"
21218,Williamsburg,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Williamsburg guest house single.
It was clean, spacious, and full of light.  We slept well and we enjoyed our little balcony. Leslie was welcoming and kind. The coffee and donuts were scrumptious. 
I look forward to returning some day.
Thank you!
"
4173664,Williamsburg,"Nous sommes restés 5 nuits dans l'appartement de Matt. Il est très bien placé, a 5 Mn a pieds du metro L qui nous a emmené en qq minutes a Manhattan. Le quartier est vraiment sympa. Nous avons récupéré les clés dans un café a proximité de l'appartement, cela a été très simple.
L'appartement est propre et fonctionnel. La salle de bain est top. 
L'appartement paraît un peu plus petit que sur les photos, Il y a un peu de bruit qui vient de l'immeuble et de l'extérieur mais c'est tout a fait supportable surtout après des journées entières de marche. Et a nyc très difficile de trouver un endroit très calme. "
13979519,Williamsburg,"He was great, very accommodating. We were able to keep in touch through text which was super convenient. Very nice, would definitely stay again"
877450,Williamsburg,"We had a great time at this perfectly located Williamsburg appartment! Sean gave us a warm welcome including delicious treats from the very recomendable Bakeri across the street. The place very spacious and cozy and for me the best is the roof terrace. I mean - where else can you sit and watch the Manhattan skyline while having a beer?

All is well equipped and we where even allowed to use the drinks and food in the fridge (we had the appartment for us, Sean moved to his girlfriend).
A treat is also the beamer including netflix :-)
I did not mind the noise, its not too bad - but it does get pretty hot and one bedroom does not have aircon. But it is managable - nothing a cold shower can not cool off. The location is perfect - right in the middle of everything, L Train 5 minute walk and food for every taste everywhere. Thanks Sean!!!!!!!"
158955,Williamsburg,"Me and my brother stayed here for 4 nights and we had a wonderful time. The apartment is spacious, so we didn't get under each others feet, clean and comfortable. Most importantly a subway stop which goes into Manhattan is right around the corner, opposite a great donut place. We were able to arrange flexible check-out which really helped for our late flight home on the last day. Amia was contactable before and during our stay. She also gave us a great list of places to try in the area. I would really recommend this apartment and staying in Williamsburg generally, if you don't want to stay in Manhattan. It has great links to Manhattan, but Williamsburg is a great place to explore itself. "
5562420,Williamsburg,Jason was great and very communicative. The house was perfect - and just what we'd hoped for. The subway was a short walk and we got into Manhattan really easily. All in all we were very pleased with the booking and would definitely recommend the house. 
1186746,Williamsburg,"We had a wonderful stay at Joshuas. He and his girlfriend are great hosts. They told us all about the neighborhood, restaurants etc. The room was nice, clean, as advertised. Key arrangements work just fine and were uncomplicated. If we'll be in NYC again, we would definitly stay here another time! Thanks Joshua for a great stay :) "
7745868,Williamsburg,The apartment it's nice but the area not so much! I don't think it's worth the money. But the host specially Camice was really nice giving me tips and everything. 
15082387,Williamsburg,"中文评价不多,我就写中文吧。Howie 这套公寓最大的优点是交通便利,门口地铁可以带你去所有景点,地铁来回机场也非常方便。这是间合租房,你可能会碰到来自不同国家的室友,大家晚上回来后小聊几句也是蛮有意思的。房间不大但有个挺宽敞的客厅吃早饭夜宵就在客厅解决。房间在一个没有电梯的公寓,行李很多的搬上去可能会有点吃力。"
660542,Williamsburg,"A girlfriend and I stayed in Peggy's Williamsburg apt. and had a BLAST on our trip because of it. Not only are you close to Bushwick and the train lines, you're in a vibrant Latin neighborhood with great food (the hallway always smells amazing) and loads to do. You will feel like a Brooklyn resident in no time staying in Peggy's place. 
I only got to meet her in passing, but Peggy was very sweet. Her mom kept everything tidy every so often and it was nice to have some extra bathroom amenities since my friend forgot to pack a few things. Can't beat the price or the experience as this was my first ""adult"" trip to NYC. Definitely make it over to Mama Pho and Momofuku Milk Bar, and the Commodore/St. Anselm are awesome and close, too. "
4476119,Williamsburg,"Wonderful experience in Brooklyn. A lovely space and a lovely host, we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay to see NYC."
14311699,Williamsburg,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
30970,Williamsburg,Abigail was a great host and very accommodating. The room was large and very nice!
369411,Williamsburg,"The place was great and super clean. It had everything we needed, instructions were spot on and super easy to follow. 
Amazing details, like amazing bookshelf, good speakers, comfiest couch.
This was an amazing stay in a well located apt. 
Thanks Ginger!"
727414,Williamsburg,I stayed for three weeks and could not be happier. Joel is the friendliest and most helpful host you could ask for. The room and flat were even a bit better than I expected. The flat is really very conveniently located right next to the subway's L line. I hope this room is available the next time I'll go to New York.
1514228,Williamsburg,"Christopher's flat was perfect as a place for me during some of my time in NYC. Although I didn't spend much time there, I found it to be a brilliant place to return to in the evenings, and well-kept and tidy. It is in the lively area of Williamsburg, just off Bedford Avenue, and about ten minutes walk to the nearest Subway. 
Christopher was a considerate and polite host, and was efficient in replying to messages, especially given the fact that he was abroad during the period I was there. Many thanks for a fantastic stay."
6235648,Williamsburg,"The studio is exactly as described and shown in pictures, very clean, and in a great area. Dishan and Geo were lovely to meet and were very flexible on when I can pick up the keys. Would come again!"
404502,Williamsburg,Really comfortable room. Jsun was super friendly and helpful. Great location--plenty of good food and drink nearby and a short walk to metro to Manhattan. Easy check in and check out. Highly recommend!

5955722,Williamsburg,Clean and spacious place to call home for a couple of nights.Close to all the great food and bars of Bedford ave. Very helpful and accommodating host. Would recommend.
348753,Williamsburg,"We had a wonderful stay at Bill’s apartment, the room is huge and very sunny, so pleasant to live there! 

Bill and Mitzi are very discreet and helpful, neighbourhood is very quiet and also full of cool places to have a drink or dinner. Can’t wait to come back and stay there again!"
152883,Williamsburg,"Justin’s place worked out perfect for us.  It was fairly inexpensive, clean, and offered basic household needs.  Close enough to explore Williamsburg by foot and easy to go back and forth to Manhattan.  The rooftop view was a plus and as others have mentioned the ladder to the bed can be tricky if you aren’t nimble but it wasn’t an issue for us.  The bed was comfy although the flat pillows were a little sad.  We didn’t spend a lot of time in the unit since we were mostly out exploring NYC but it was nice to be able to come home and rest after a long day.  It was easy to communicate with Justin and he even accommodated our early morning flight and we were able to check in early.   "
6936157,Williamsburg,"James was great! He was very friendly and welcoming, and he even carried my two heavy suitcases up the stairs. The room and apt were clean, and the bed was comfortable. It was an easy walk to the subway in a neighborhood that has a lot to offer. "
1511569,Williamsburg,"Staying at John's place was probably the best experience I could have dreamed of.
It was my first booking through Airbnb and I can't believe how lucky I was!

Many of the previous comments from guests have insisted on the stunning view from the ""Skybox"", on the beautifully arranged terrace, room and bathroom: undoubtedly, these were more than incredible in themselves.

For those of you who may wonder about the logistics of a stay abroad, do not worry at all: everything is perfect. 
Very good mattress, bed linen and heating system (A/C for the summer), flatscreen tv and wifi. Coffee or tea pretty much anytime you want.
The place is easy to find and a 15min drive from JFK airport. It is situated in a trendy area that is as safe as can be. 

There are many cool things to do in the neighborhood, if you want to discover a different vibe from Manhattan: restaurants, bars, shops and the East river walk, even a jog in the park right opposite the building if you're into running.

What made the difference to me however was John himself: it's hard to find words to define this tremendously generous, open-minded, reliable and caring person. 
His sense of humour, his availability, the way he always pays attention not to intrude while readily sharing with you whenever you feel like it, made me feel welcome right away.
We shared the most interesting conversations and generally had quite a laugh doing so.

It's impossible not to mention Kevin, John's adorable dog, who is definitely the disarmingly charming prince of the castle - and believe me, I'm usually not a dog person at all!

A piece of advice: do not hesitate to book the Skybox. 
It will be a great experience, for first-timers in NYC (where else would you get this view, day and night, even from your bed?) and for anyone who enjoys a really friendly atmosphere on top of a comfortable and tastefully decorated room.

The place itself is just outstanding, and it has such a unique owner! :-)

Thank you, John, for sharing your place and making my stay unforgettable."
11528996,Williamsburg,"Piril, thank you for being such a gracious host. I felt very comfortable staying in your home. I'm very intrigued with what you have done with the space! I also got to meet a lot interesting artists, which now I can call my friends. Highly recommend staying here if you're not too high maintenance and prefer and authentic experience. The location is perfect and the residents themselves are very warm hearted people. "
13585835,Williamsburg,"We had a great stay in the apartment during our three nights in New York and bushwick. The apartment is situated in heart of bushwick and is close to restaurants and bars. Pierre and Mira were great hosts and we can definitely recommend this room.

33009,Williamsburg,Our 2nd stay at Mings and Matts apartment!!! And again it was awesome! Particularly clean and so nice. We really felt home this time and we are looking forward to come back soon. Ming and Matt are  so likeable and really contribute to our wonderful stay in NYC.
13101869,Williamsburg,"I LOVED my stay at Michael's place. Michael was very helpful, the room was cosy and clean and gave great privacy, and the apartment is in a great location in Brooklyn, close to 3 subway lines (the M, G & L). I'd definitely stay here again next time in New York."
2924834,Williamsburg,"This was a really great place to stay. The room is huge with lots of storage space, work space, a very comfortable bed and everything I needed (hair dryer etc all provided) and the location is excellent – seconds from the L into town and very close to Williamsburg's bars & restaurants, but just enough away that it feels like a peaceful escape. Jon was a wonderful host - super attentive and really proactive at checking in and making sure I had everything I needed. Thanks! "
2071446,Williamsburg,"Great experience and awesome place. I am very pleased with my staying at katja's place. She was very caring in making sure I found the apartment. The neighborhood is great, very safe and very close to the subway (10 min ride to the city). Definitely recommend."
2725385,Williamsburg,Lesa was a great host and very flexible and easy to communicate with. The apartment was very clean and tidy with all amenities you could need with an equal amount of quirkiness!!

Very recommended!
9740010,Williamsburg,"Great and nice location. Place was tiny, but very clean and had everything we needed."

16429097,Williamsburg,"Merci Greicy, le logement est sympathique et aucun problème de stationnement. Je garde vos coordonnées pour un prochain séjour."
635282,Williamsburg,"The apartment is in the perfect spot – surrounded by tons of nice coffee shops, hip stores and restaurants, but still very quiet during the night. We were there during hurricane Sandy and we had both power and water and felt very secure in the apartment/building. It’s very easy to get to and from the apartment with both subways and ferries.  The apartment is very nice and well equipped.  Despite the hurricane we had a wonderful stay! Melissa is very friendly and easy to communicate with and very flexible.  Will definitely try to stay there again next time we go to NY."
13936824,Williamsburg,"Amazing time in a cosy and perfectly located Brooklyn-typical apartment! Cindy and Naief are really kind people, we were delighted to meet them."

44161,Williamsburg,"Young's apartment was absolutely fantastic! My two friends and I stayed for 11 nights. The apartment is very large for New York standards, and very comfortable. Amazing location - near great cafés and shops in Williamsburg, and subway stations for easy and fast travel to Manhattan. Young was a terrific host - leaving such things including NYC travel books in the apartment to look through, as well power point adapters and even playing cards! This was my second time staying in this apartment, and both stays were amazing. 10/10 would recommend and would stay again. "
1031302,Williamsburg,"Staying with Andrew was awesome. His place was cozy and in a safe part of town. We really enjoyed our stay. He was very helpful. He provided us with towels which were very helpful because we did not have any. The only complaint we had was that it was a bit too hot in the room, besides that it was a perfect stay. Thank you Andrew."
8472069,Williamsburg,"This has been a great trip. Josh and Chris really earn the flag superhost. It's a small apartment but both of them gave us a lot of space. Everything was well prepared from the beginning and both were always available for questions and tips.

Dies war ein großartiger Trip. Josh und Chris sind verdiente Superhosts. Es ist ein kleines Apartment, jedoch wurde uns viel Freiraum gelassen. Alles war gut vorbereitet und die beiden waren für Fragen und Tips immer erreichbar."
11461813,Williamsburg,"We had a good stay at zhana's and adams appartment! We have booked it relatively shortterm; communication was prompt & friendly. The time we stayed in ny was very hot: in the appartment we were able to cool down :-)
Metro was close, good departure point to explore manhattan!"
4315562,Williamsburg,Great little place! Didn't mind the walk-up but maybe some older folks might. Really convenient location to all the train lines I needed.
2153435,Williamsburg,"Apartment was amazing, great location, and in 30 degree heat the balcony was a god send. Everything you might need is provided in the apartment and it feels really big and spacious with a quality feel. Russell was a perfect communicator and all instructions were accurate and clear. We loved Williamsburg and we had the best view of manhattan, I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"
14273960,Williamsburg,"I enjoyed my stay at Adam's apartment. It was such a great location close to lively nightlife, coffee shops to work, and a nice central location overall. 

Adam was quick to respond to any questions I had. Check in/out was very smooth. I would definitely reccommend staying here; mostly because of the location and spaciousness of the apartment."
13281117,Williamsburg,"My husband and I had a really lovely stay at Jonah's apartment in Brooklyn. The place is even nicer than how it's shown in the current pics, with some newer furniture throughout the apartment. Location is great--the subway stop for the L train is just a block away, making our trip to Chelsea all of 15, 20 minutes tops. For everything we wanted to do in Brooklyn, we were never more than a 20-minute walk away. Street parking was a little tricky to find at first, but once we were parked we were able to leave our car in that spot all weekend long with no trouble. The neighborhood felt very safe. And Jonah was super easy to work with. He welcomed us personally, and was easy to communicate with throughout the process. Would definitely recommend this place to couples and anyone traveling alone."
257787,Williamsburg,"Perfect location (central in Wburg and only 2 stops to Manhattan!), really nice and quiet apartment, very sweet and helpful host. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

5750426,Williamsburg,"Although we didn't actually see Jon much, we felt comfortable in his apartment. We could make good arrangements with him and the room we rented had everything that was described. It was spacious, the heating was great, we could put things away and that was also nice ! The shower was very good and the fact that we could use his kitchen was also a very nice thing !"
4652059,Williamsburg,"Strongly recommended. Couldn't have gone better. Stayed one night, flew in for a music event in Williamsburg on a Sat evening. Comfortable beds and great view of Manhattan skyline. Excellent proximity to many restaurants/bars. Apt is ideal pre-game spot prior to your night out. Eyal was a real nice dude, very accommodating and good communication.  "

3513303,Williamsburg,"Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Zeit in New York!

Megan haben wir nur einmal kurz gesehen, da sie über das Wochenende verreist ist. Das Zimmer ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und sauber. Auch frische Handtücher, Seifen und Zahnbürsten standen für uns bereit.
Die wichtigsten U-Bahnverbindungen sind zu Fuß sehr gut erreichbar und auch die Gegend ist sehr sicher.

Vielen Dank Megan und Alex!

324115,Williamsburg,Melanie was a fantastic host and did everything she could to make sure my stay was enjoyable and convenient. Arranged access to suit around my arrival time and was just all round a great host. Plus the flat is in such an amazing neighbourhood so all in all I couldn't have asked for anything more!
584079,Williamsburg,"My friend and I spent two very pleasant weeks in Ming's apartment during June/July. The apartment is just lovely; light and bright with charming furniture and beautiful bedding. The kitchen is fully equipped and allowed us to enjoy home breakfasts and dinners. The aircon was very welcomed on the hot days and the use of the turntable and records was great. There is no TV but WiFi negates the need for a TV. The apartment is in a super location; the street does get noisy at night due to activity on the street but was not an issue for us. Bars, cafes and shops are within walking distance; the subway station is a 5-10 minute walk and a fantastic cinema rift around the street.
Best of all is the host Ming who I was lucky to meet due to an issue with the key - fantastic host, brilliant to deal with and is everything that other reviewers have said she is.  Accommodating, communicative and honest with a wonderful apartment. Thanks Ming for your hospitality; my only regret is not staying longer.

P.S second floor to an Australian means first floor! Only one flight of stairs up "
4709695,Williamsburg,Great space and great hosts! We only wish that the weather had been warmer so that we could have taken full advantage of the outside patio/veranda. Convenient location and easy access to all we wanted. Highly recommended!!!!
11522815,Williamsburg,"Very comfortable and convenient apartment, just as it looks in the pictures. Great location at walking distance from the centre of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), and very good value for money for a city like New York. The kitchen is also fully equipped in case you want to cook something. Therese was extremely helpful and responsive all the time. Definitely recommendable!"
183818,Williamsburg,"Veronica was the perfect host and her place was just as perfect. The location was great for anyone looking to take in the Brooklyn vibe. 
Loved how close the L train was to her place and all the local restaurants she recommended were spot on. "

2791758,Williamsburg,I lived with Chris and his flat mate Chris for 6 days. They really make me feel like home. It is extremely neat and clean. The room has a good view and you can go to the balcony for fresh air or just cigarette. We had good talk and I tried a lot from their recommendation. Very nice experience living with Chris and Chris. Highly recommend. 
8099544,Williamsburg,"Ekaterina made check-in and check-out super easy, and her apartment is gorgeous and cosy. It legitimately looks just like it does in the pictures. The area has some good bars and restaurants nearby, and it's super easy to get into Manhattan and around Brooklyn, thanks to the transport options."
364275,Williamsburg,"I arrived here at 8am having just flown over from LA where everything is sunshine.
It was freezing, I had a million bags with me and all I wanted was a bed to curl up in. Rico greeted me with a big hug and carried my things inside. He took me over to a dive diner for a meal and I was happy. My stay here was super enjoyable! Rico lent me a push bike one day that I rode around Brooklyn in. Another time I was lucky enough to enjoy a ride on the back of his motorcycle. His housemates are lovely, we had good chats. The area around this place is super neat! I would definitely come back to stay here again when I'm next in NY! Thanks Rico :)"
7110032,Williamsburg,"Fred was so great! Such a nice dude and a stellar place. Right by the train, grocery, cute places to hang. We've stayed at other places in Brooklyn that were dirty / gross and Fred's space was such a relief. Clean, easy to move around, felt like a little home of our own.  100% want to stay here again!"
490608,Williamsburg,Awesome host! I will look to stay at Suzanne's place  anytime I come to Brooklyn! Thanks again!
5863458,Williamsburg,Had a great stay! Close to public transportation if you want to explore the city and free street parking in the area. The apartment was very unique and had two beautiful private rooms. John was a great host and extremely helpful with all of our questions and concerns. Overall great stay! 
9431085,Williamsburg,The apartment was spacious and centrally located for our stay in Brooklyn 
5990587,Williamsburg,Thanks for having us Rene!
3420223,Williamsburg,Abby has a super cool apartment and was very clear in communicating with us. The place is just as advertised and is very conveniently located close to the L. We had a very nice time and would definitely stay again.
10060921,Williamsburg,"Tyler was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed! He even checked in to give us restaurant recommendations.

The space itself was just like the pictures and beautiful! We loved the view, if you can wake up for sunrise you won't regret it. The little artifacts from all over the world add a lot of character to this place. It's also convenient to get into Manhattan and to hang around Williamsburg. Overall fun experience! "
6130957,Williamsburg,"Max & Kumiko are amazing hosts that made me feel welcome and at home. The room is bright, spacious and has EVERYTHING you need. The place is very clean and taken care of, and the area very hip. The highlight of my stay were the very loving pups Goldie and Jackie. "
2310594,Williamsburg,Awesome place in Brooklyn! I would definitely stay there again!
4784493,Williamsburg,"We felt very welcomed with a set of lovely colorful and sweet little sticky notes greeting us. Our room was great, comfy, clean, and for NYC spacious for sure. We met a number of nice neighbors. The location to the gray line could not have been more convenient. The neighborhood was industrial but covered in beautiful graffiti. "
1586927,Williamsburg,"We had a wonderful stay in Livia's apartment, it sure is a home away from home. It has everything you need and is located in a super cool neighbourhood. The check-in went smoothly, Livia and her friend provided us with detailed information about everything we needed to know. We would really recommend her apartment! "
10680417,Williamsburg,Great place easy to communicate with host would recommend to a friend. Also excellent location!! A+++
9381657,Williamsburg,"Lovely place that I'd highly recommend for a real- NYC experience.  Great location as close as you could get to a subway without it being too too loud.  Then also straddled between great places in Brooklyn if you go west, north, or all around.  

Comfortable bright bedroom with a table, clothing rack, shelves, and then a bed on the floor.  Good lighting throughout apartment. 

This is a fourth floor with some good exercise when you're up there, but once you are you feel at home and I couldn't say better things about the hosts. Highly recommend it!"
4553528,Williamsburg,"Nice sunny apartment in prime location - just a few blocks from Bedford av, waterfront, tons of bars and restaurants. Kitchen is fully stocked, and there is a wooden deck that's great for dining and hanging out. Highly recommend! "
1549641,Williamsburg,"Sarahs place is amazing! As soon as I stepped inside the door I felt like home. The athmosfair is warm and cozy and it has everything you need. It's located central in Williamsburg but on a quite and calm street which is nice.  The apartment also has a little garden where that I could enjoy a coffee then the sun was shining! So nice! Sarah is a lovely host, helpful and caring. Always respond back when I had some questions!.
I can definitely recommend to stay here! <3"
6543450,Williamsburg,"My experience at Aimee's place is not what I am searching with Airbnb. I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and we haven't met Aimee once. I honestly felt like an intruder coming in her place without any sign of welcoming. I sent 1 message via airbnb and 3 text messages. The only reply I got from Aimee was a 3-word text message. Hopefully, the room looks like the pics because that's how we found where we should stay... There is an aquarium in the room which made a lot of noise but we could unplug it. The only way to refresh the room is to let the door open, not very convenient when the 3 other rooms are also rent. Honestly, for that price (145€ per night, all fees included) and all the comments, I was hoping something more.
Other thing, the apartment is very noisy. We could hear all the people coming into the building, climbing the stairs... The floor neighbors wouldn't have made more noise with their door opens.
The good points are a comfy bed and the great location. 
Besides that, I don't recommend this place."
7307941,Williamsburg,Jean was a great host! Apt was perfect. Clean and exactly as described. Would stay here every time I'm in Brooklyn.  
6702379,Williamsburg,"An ideal location in the hippest and most buzzing part of Williamsburg, with great restaurants, bars, bookstores and the heartbeat of young artists and thinkers everywhere. A very comfortable and reasonably quiet room, in a large converted loft, a generous and soft bed, plenty of hot tea and basic amenities, and a trustworthy and gracious host. I'll be back. "
4077427,Williamsburg,"The apartment is very nice ! comfortable and clean. We had everything we needed. Daniel is a great host. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, just few metro stops from Manhattan. . We really enjoyed !"
3549798,Williamsburg,We loved our stay at John's apartment. The apartment was as described and was in a great location close to lots of great shops and restaurants and with easy access to Manhattan. Although we didn't get to meet John he kept in contact and made sure everything went well. We would definitely stay again!
5383005,Williamsburg,"This apartment is very modern and very clean.  It is in a good neighborhood, with stores, restaurants and good coffee shops close by.   The bed is very comfortable.  "
3414885,Williamsburg,"I have been staying more than 20 Airbnb rooms in the States and Europe. Blake's apartment became one of my favourite! Only 2 blocks to Subway L station which take you to Manhattan in 6 minutes. Good bars, restaurants and stores are 3-4 minutes walk. But it's quiet residential area.

The rooms are very nicely decorated as you see in the photos. Blake is also a great host. Easy to communicate and provided me lots of useful information for me. I recommend this place highly to my friends."
14421258,Williamsburg,Nice spot. Works well for Brooklyn or Manhattan. 
3542523,Williamsburg,"Home away from home, Jack couldn't make it any less welcoming or comfortable to share his place. My first time staying with someone and it was perfect.

Great location and way better than the other couple days spent in Manhattan. Would 100% recommend "
131699,Williamsburg,"Rob and pilar ´s apartment is just perfect, we had a good intimity with a private bathroom and room. The apartment´s configuration is well appropriate to share the space without disturbing each other. It was very easy to take possession of the keys and enter the apartment when ever we wanted. The virtual concierge makes the things flexibles.
Rob and Pilar are very welcoming, and helpful. The adresses in their neighborhood are really nice.
We really advise this place, near the subway to Manhattan, if you want to stay in Brooklyn."
65660,Williamsburg,"Larissa's appartement was like on the pictures, very cozy and clean. It was really close to the subway which is very usefull ! We enjoyed our stay. Larissa's left us a little book with some places she likes in NY and Brooklyn, it is a good idea. Thank you.

I recommend Larissa's appartement ! "
298073,Williamsburg,Excellent place in a great location - cannot recommend this enough
690553,Williamsburg,Absolutely loved Wrays place! My friends and I thought her three bedroom loft was the perfect amount of space for us. We found several places within walking distance that we enjoyed. We all hope to be back in Brooklyn soon. <3 
726465,Williamsburg,"While making a short trip to Williamsburg, I was fortunate to slot myself with a friend at Elli's.  Elli was very responsive and organized.  Her space is a very nice room; nicely designed, felt like a retreat.  And ideal with a personal entrance to come and go quietly.  Her location is ideal heart of Williamsburg just outside the door.  I highly recommend staying with Elli."
15238852,Williamsburg,Nick & Anne-Marie's place is exactly as advertised - a cool hip artsy place in the heart of Williamsburg. The communication was smooth throughout and the place was clean & personable. Would recommend it to anyone who wants charm & convenience.
1294417,Williamsburg,"The Waterbury House was awesome! Elissa and her family (including PP the cat) were great hosts, and the E. Williamsburg location was perfect. It's a quick walk to the Montrose Station and L line, and there are several cool restaurants and bars in the area. I definitely hope to stay here again, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else traveling to the city!"
3439664,Williamsburg,"Our host was very welcoming, all the communication was straightforward and clear. We loved the nice apartment and the location is fantastic,right in the centre of all that Williamsburg offers.
Everything was just perfect for the three of us. We would happily stay there again and hope to do exactly that. "
1604488,Williamsburg,Bernardo and Andressa were lovely and their home is stunning. Clean bright and beautifully furnished in an amazing location in Brooklyn. Getting into the apartment was easy even though we were arriving very early in the morning. We enjoyed having a beer and a chat with them on a lazy Saturday afternoon and they gave us great advice about places to go out and eat. Of course this review would not be complete without mention of their beautiful dog who also made our stay very enjoyable with her playful yet placid attitude and welcoming us when we came home from a day of sight seeing. We would certainly stay here again. 
16414226,Williamsburg,Loved this place. Bed was super comfortable and the appartment is close to everything you need. The best :) 
26969,Williamsburg,"We had a great stay in this fabulous home! My wife and I brought our nephews (6 and 8) to the city for the weekend and this home was the perfect location for our stay. The subway entrance is half a block away as are the shops and restaurants of Bedford Avenue. The nephews enjoyed playing songs on the jukebox and the assorted children's toys available in the living room. 

This is a VERY large space for this neighborhood and location!
We highly recommend this home!"
7649846,Williamsburg,If you're looking to get a taste of Williamsburg then this is definitely the place to stay! You are a block away from the subway and as soon as you leave the apartment you are in the heart of the neighborhood. The room was a nice size and  everything was very clean. Megan is a very thoughtful host and was sure to provide us with everything we needed and more. I definitely recommend this room to those looking to stay in Brooklyn.
6420987,Williamsburg,"Amazing apartment in a perfect location in Williamsburg.  The apartment is beautiful, very clean (even better than the pictures) and well equipped with everything... not to mention the spectacular view. Great bars and restaurants are all within a short walking distance, as well as Bedford Station that is one stop into Manhattan. 
Supermarket and lovely wine shop is at the base of the apartment, which is convenient.
Communication with Mariquel was perfect and she was very helpful. 
We can't wait to visit again."
6970441,Williamsburg,"This was such a wonderful place to stay. Very cozy, inviting, and comfortable. I came for a business trip and wanted to stay in the Brooklyn area because I'd never been to that part of New York before. The location was very close to the subway so it made for an great location to get around and see the sights. Walking distance to some cute restaurants in the neighborhood which also was a perk! I would definitely stay here again!"
21220,Williamsburg,From the moment we arrived at the apartment we loved the place. The welcome doughnut was just what I needed following the long flight over to NY. Check-in was really quick and there is a handy guide in the apartment on the area with some good recommendations. The apartment and area are perfect and after a few hours I felt like I was living in Williamsburg not visiting. There is large supermarket around 10 mins walk away which is perfect if you want to make use of the kitchen. We didn't really make use of the kitchen due to the excellent variety of restaurants around the area. Check-out was just as easy. I wouldn't hesitate at booking again. If you are looking for a great base to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan (not that you need to) then you won't go wrong with Susan and Leslie's place. 5 star all round. 
20793,Williamsburg,"We had a wonderful stay at Leslie's carriage house suite. She was a great host - very informative and helpful, and flexible with regards to arrival and departure. The apartment was perfect for our short stay, and I would choose it again for a longer trip as well. The kitchen is perfectly equipped and the welcome donuts were fabulous. The neighborhood was charming and very family friendly. "
545949,Williamsburg,Todd and Azul were very welcoming. This place is so cool and perfect for a weekend get away with friends. The space is unique and has everything you could need for a fun and relaxing time. 100% recommend staying here. Great location:) 
413504,Williamsburg,"Amazing! This was my first airbnb experience - Omri's place was fantastic. First of all location- it's great. We wanted to stay in Brooklyn, but still be close to Manhatten. It was so easy to get in, and out. You are literally right on the subway - L train which is easy to get in, and usually took us about 15-20 mins to get most places we wanted to. Brooklyn is also great too, and we spent some nights in nearby restaurants and bars which was fun. The apartment is great too - really clean, really nice. Lots of space for clothes! We only met Omri once, and he was really nice. He was also great at communication - we came about a week after Sandy and he was emailing me before keeping me updated on the subway status. He was incredibly helpful, and even emailed me suggestions for restaurants/bars too. Couldn't ask for a better host. Next time I'm in New York, I'll be back!"
